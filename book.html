<h2><a name="question28494"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/28494">This is important. I need you to listen…</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">292 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5208">Alconja#5208</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/11876">Deusovi#11876</a></p>

<p>Look, you don't know me. We've never met. But, like I said, I need you to listen...</p>

<p>I had the most disturbing dream the other night... Woke up in a cold sweat and couldn't get back to sleep. It wasn't a nightmare as such, just ... eerie, I guess? I don't even remember the details, but it left me with a real sense of foreboding. Weird thing about dreams, so clear when you have them, but the details fade so quickly... Vivid, yet fuzzy... And the strange logic that applies... Inconsistent flow of time... Disjointed cause and effect...</p>

<p>I'm rambling... The thing is, when I woke up, I found an odd magazine clipping on my bedside table. It feels so familiar, like I've had it for quite a while, but for some reason, I can't remember how or when I acquired it. Wherever it came from, all I know is that it I gives me the same creepy feeling my dream did.</p>

<p>Anyway, the strangest part about all this is... And perhaps you won't believe me... But, this piece of paper, I think...</p>

<p>...I think it's meant for <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>The magnets are tetrominoes. There are 7 of each shape. Is it possible to arrange them into a 7x28 rectangle so that they are all used and all inside the rectangle?</p>

<p><strong>Hints:</strong></p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> You don't need any hints, they are littered throughout the images everywhere, and I'm not giving you any more. :)<br>
<br>
 Ok, I will perhaps assist in framing things a little... This is actually a deceptively simple puzzle (though, simple $\ne$ easy). It isn't multiple layers deep, even if it may appear that way. In fact, there's really only a single puzzle to be solved here, and I believe it's actually doable with information from only three of the images. Most of the rest are hints and pointers to make your life easier, but also to distract a little. Part of the challenge is in filtering the truly necessary information from the noise, and in taking the lessons learned from the hints and applying them to the actual puzzle.<br>
<br>
 I'll just add one last bit of extra information (which you shouldn't take as a hint, so much as a clarification, for when you get a certain distance in): The security panel's circuitry contains a paradox prevention system...</p>

<p>I was walking home late last night and heard raised voices coming from a boarded up old warehouse. I stopped, out of sight, to listen...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>[When I started eavesdropping, the conversation was already under way...]</em> </p>
  
  <p><strong>Gangster 1</strong>: -infiltrator in our midst, and I know who it is... <em>[dramatic pause]</em> ...It's you isn't it!<br>
  <strong>Gangster 2</strong>: Me?<br>
  <strong>G1</strong>: What? No... him.<br>
  <strong>Gangster 3</strong>: That's ridiculous! I'm no traitor! How do we know it's not you?!<br>
  <strong>G2</strong>: It's not me!<br>
  <strong>G3</strong>: No... him... <em>[under breath]</em> ...idiot.<br>
  <strong>G1</strong>: That doesn't even make sense. I'm the most prolific amongst us. When would I even have the chance to work for the opposition?<br>
  <strong>G3</strong>: What do you mean? I'm in every day!<br>
  <strong>Gangster 4</strong>: <em>[to himself]</em> Me too, but you don't hear me harping on...<br>
  <strong>G3</strong>: <em>[continuing]</em> Not to mention I saw you with your ex last week on my way out of here... And I won't mention who I saw him hanging out with <em>again</em> yesterday...<br>
  <strong>G2</strong>: We weren't hanging out! I was just stuck behind him in a queue!<br>
  <strong>Gangster 5</strong>: Hey, we all fraternize with the enemy now and then... It's necessary to meet our goals... But this is different. From what I hear, half the time you act like you <em>are</em> one of them!  </p>
  
  <p><em>[A street sweeper drove slowly by, so I missed a little of the conversation...]</em>  </p>
  
  <p><strong>G3</strong>: It's a set up! Think about it... Who would gain the most from seeing me dead? ...I would!<br>
  <strong>Gangster 6</strong>: 'strue, but 'e would too...<br>
  <strong>G1</strong>: Sure, he occasionally fills in for me, but he could practically replace you!<br>
  <strong>G2</strong>: No he couldn't!<br>
  <strong>G6/G1/G3</strong>: Would you shut up!<br>
  <strong>G4</strong>: Geez settle down guys, what's with all the yelling?<br>
  <strong>G1</strong>: Because no one was talking to you!<br>
  <strong>G4</strong>: Ahh... Gotcha...  </p>
  
  <p><em>[A crowd of drunken revellers stumbled by and as I slipped into an alley to remain unseen, I missed another few minutes of the argument...]</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>G1</strong>: Gimme one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now!<br>
  <strong>G2</strong>: I didn't do anything wrong!<br>
  <strong>G3</strong>: Wait... Who are we talking about now?<br>
  <strong>G1</strong>: You!<br>
  <strong>G2</strong>: Oh...<br>
  <strong>G5</strong>: Why?<br>
  <strong>G1</strong>: Yes!  </p>
  
  <p><em>[From here things escalated rapidly, and when gunshots were fired, I made a run for it...]</em>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I went to the police but when they visited the scene, the gang was gone, and everything had already been cleaned. They said there wasn't enough to go on unless I could identify the victim and the perpetrators.</p>

<p><strong>Who was the gang?</strong><br>
<strong>Which member was killed?</strong><br>
<strong>Why were they killed?</strong>  </p>

<h2><a name="question31247"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/31247">Game of Life: Kill the Sun</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">152 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/20572">BaSzAt#20572</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/15856">kamenf#15856</a></p>

<p>Below is an initial state for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" rel="noreferrer">Conway's Game of Life</a> with a single pulsar. Living cells are white.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iid1g.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/Iid1g.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>The area marked with red is your base. You are free to modify any of the red cells, but only those, and only in the initial generation. You are not allowed to do anything once the simulation starts.</p>

<p>Your goal is to annihilate every living cell in the grid – in other words, the game must reach a generation where every cell is dead, even in your base. Yet in other, way cooler words: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have to construct a rocket to destroy the Sun and everything that was created in the process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The grid is infinite in every direction, i. e. runaway gliders still count as living.</p>

<p>You may use a brute force algorithm if you really wish, but I don't recommend you to. For one thing, you're up against the halting problem. Besides, finding a good construction all by yourself is fun (at least it was for me).</p>

<p>What I do recommend is downloading a good GoL simulator – solving this with only a paper and a pencil is probably not so much fun.</p>

<p class="subtitle">134 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/185">dwjohnston#185</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/310">njzk2#310</a></p>

<h3>The riddle</h3>

<p>Randall Munroe (of <a href="https://xkcd.com">xkcd</a> fame) has, a bit hidden on his site, <a href="https://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html">a logic puzzle</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A group of people with assorted eye colors live on an island. They are
  all perfect logicians -- if a conclusion can be logically deduced,
  they will do it instantly. No one knows the color of their eyes. Every
  night at midnight, a ferry stops at the island. Any islanders who have
  figured out the color of their own eyes then leave the island, and the
  rest stay. Everyone can see everyone else at all times and keeps a
  count of the number of people they see with each eye color (excluding
  themselves), but they cannot otherwise communicate. Everyone on the
  island knows all the rules in this paragraph.</p>
  
  <p>On this island there are 100 blue-eyed people, 100 brown-eyed people,
  and the Guru (she happens to have green eyes). So any given blue-eyed
  person can see 100 people with brown eyes and 99 people with blue eyes
  (and one with green), but that does not tell him his own eye color; as
  far as he knows the totals could be 101 brown and 99 blue. Or 100
  brown, 99 blue, and he could have red eyes.</p>
  
  <p>The Guru is allowed to speak once (let's say at noon), on one day in
  all their endless years on the island. Standing before the islanders,
  she says the following:</p>
  
  <p>"I can see someone who has blue eyes."</p>
  
  <p>Who leaves the island, and on what night?</p>
  
  <p>There are no mirrors or reflecting surfaces, nothing dumb. It is not a
  trick question, and the answer is logical. It doesn't depend on tricky
  wording or anyone lying or guessing, and it doesn't involve people
  doing something silly like creating a sign language or doing genetics.
  The Guru is not making eye contact with anyone in particular; she's
  simply saying "I count at least one blue-eyed person on this island
  who isn't me."</p>
  
  <p>And lastly, the answer is not "no one leaves."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He admits the puzzle isn't his:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I didn't come up with the idea of this puzzle, but I've written and rewritten it over the the years to try to make a definitive version. The guy who told it to me originally was some dude on the street in Boston named Joel.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>The answer</h3>

<p>He gives <a href="https://xkcd.com/solution.html">his solution</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The answer is that on the 100th day, all 100 blue-eyed people will leave. It's pretty convoluted logic and it took me a while to believe the solution, but here's a rough guide to how to get there. Note -- while the text of the puzzle is very carefully worded to be as clear and unambiguous as possible (thanks to countless discussions with confused readers), this solution is pretty thrown-together. It's correct, but the explanation/wording might not be the best. If you're really confused by something, let me know.</p>
  
  <p>If you consider the case of just one blue-eyed person on the island, you can show that he obviously leaves the first night, because he knows he's the only one the Guru could be talking about. He looks around and sees no one else, and knows he should leave. So: [THEOREM 1] If there is one blue-eyed person, he leaves the first night.</p>
  
  <p>If there are two blue-eyed people, they will each look at the other. They will each realize that "if I don't have blue eyes [HYPOTHESIS 1], then that guy is the only blue-eyed person. And if he's the only person, by THEOREM 1 he will leave tonight." They each wait and see, and when neither of them leave the first night, each realizes "My HYPOTHESIS 1 was incorrect. I must have blue eyes." And each leaves the second night.</p>
  
  <p>So: [THEOREM 2]: If there are two blue-eyed people on the island, they will each leave the 2nd night.</p>
  
  <p>If there are three blue-eyed people, each one will look at the other two and go through a process similar to the one above. Each considers the two possibilities -- "I have blue eyes" or "I don't have blue eyes." He will know that if he doesn't have blue eyes, there are only two blue-eyed people on the island -- the two he sees. So he can wait two nights, and if no one leaves, he knows he must have blue eyes -- THEOREM 2 says that if he didn't, the other guys would have left. When he sees that they didn't, he knows his eyes are blue. All three of them are doing this same process, so they all figure it out on day 3 and leave.</p>
  
  <p>This induction can continue all the way up to THEOREM 99, which each person on the island in the problem will of course know immediately. Then they'll each wait 99 days, see that the rest of the group hasn't gone anywhere, and on the 100th night, they all leave.</p>
  
  <p>Before you email me to argue or question: This solution is correct. My explanation may not be the clearest, and it's very difficult to wrap your head around (at least, it was for me), but the facts of it are accurate. I've talked the problem over with many logic/math professors, worked through it with students, and analyzed from a number of different angles. The answer is correct and proven, even if my explanations aren't as clear as they could be.</p>

  <li>What is the quantified piece of information that the Guru provides that each person did not already have? </li>
  <li>Each person knows, from the beginning, that there are no less than 99 blue-eyed people on the island. How, then, is considering the 1 and 2-person cases relevant, if they can all rule them out immediately as possibilities? </li>
  <li>Why do they have to wait 99 nights if, on the first 98 or so of these nights, they're simply verifying something that they already know? </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>These are just to give you something to think about if you enjoyed the main solution. They have answers, but please don't email me asking for them. They're meant to prompt thought on the solution, and each can be answered by considering the solution from the right angle, in the right terms. There's a different way to think of the solution involving hypotheticals inside hypotheticals, and it is much more concrete, if a little harder to discuss. But in it lies the key to answering the four questions above.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>The question</h3>

<p>Everybody on the island could have come to the conclusion that 'There is at least one person with blue eyes', simply by looking around, seeing 100 people with blue eyes, and realising that everybody can see at least one person with blue eyes.</p>

<p><strong>So why is it necessary for the Guru to say 'I see at least one person with blue eyes' to get the ball rolling?</strong></p>

<p>Two adventurers, Merlin and Hermes, approached a large iron door built into a cliff face."Well...", said Hermes, "What do we do now?". Merlin produced an old, large piece of crumpled paper from his pocket. "Hrm...", Merlin mumbled. "It says here that we must speak the six letter keyword to open the door and enter the secret chamber, but I don't remember seeing any signs as to what that keyword might be..."</p>

<p>After a bit of searching, Hermes notices something etched into the ground. "Come over here!", he yelled, pointing frantically. And sure enough, barely visible and obscured by dust, was a series of lines of differing color etched into the ground:</p>

<p><img src="images/BXWwr.png" alt="You&#39;re looking at it the wrong way!"></p>

<p>"Ah", Merlin said, "So that is the keyword." Hermes was lost and confused. After staring at it for another thirty seconds, he grumbled "What keyword!? All I see is a bunch of lines!". Merlin simply responded, "You're just <em>looking at it the wrong way</em>. It's obvious!"</p>

<p>You are a double-agent in the most important war of the 20th century, The
Falklands war. For years you have been playing the United Kingdom and Argentinian
governments against each other, taking bribes from both sides and it has caught
up with you.</p>

<p>One day travelling you are snatched off the street, kidnapped, drugged and
placed on a private plane. You wake up in a cell, you know you have been taken by
one of the governments to their capital for interrogation and treason charges but
you cannot tell which has abducted you. You have perfected both the UK and
Argentinian languages and accents and you know you can convince the guards to
let you go if you were to speak in their native tongue asking for your
government contact. However speaking the wrong language first will
certainly turn out very poorly for you indeed.</p>

<p>You look around your cell, it is a large room with high ceilings, a musty smell,
and thick dust covering everything. Based on being unable to hear anything and
the constant temperature you conclude you are underground. Nothing about the architecture is distinctive. The only things in
the cell are a single metal chair bolted to the floor in the center of the room
with a spotlight hanging from a cord right above the chair illuminating the
seat brightly leaving the rest of the room in shadow. You know it is a matter of time
before you are tied into the chair and interrogated by shadowy agents of one of
the governments. </p>

<p>You search desperately for a clue as to where you are. You
kick the chair and stub your toe; it is solid. You claw at the light, looking for a marking
or a way to open it and see the voltage rating but cannot find either. You yank
and pull on it to test how secure it is and cannot dislodge it from the ceiling
to get at the cord. You try to swing it far enough to smash against a wall but it will not reach. You search the chair for a makers mark but can find none.
You know much more action will invite suspicion even if you know the right
language so you stand back and think.</p>

<p>The guard watching on CCTV notices, but decides it is normal behaviour for
someone waking up in a cell regardless of guilt so is not immediately
suspicious. As far as he can tell you then pace around the room randomly for a
few hours deep in thought.</p>

<p>You suddenly walk towards the door and knock, with 100% confidence you
correctly ask in perfect Spanish for your government handler who promptly
releases you.</p>

<p>How did you know what government to ask for?</p>

<ul>
<li><em>You can assume you are correct in all your assumptions mentioned in the puzzle.</em></li>
<li><em>You have no items other than the clothes and shoes you were wearing when abducted. no cell phone, no watch, no pocket lint etc.</em></li>

<h2><a name="question33523"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/33523">The Rube Wordberg Machine</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">113 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5208">Alconja#5208</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/21234">Dan Russell#21234</a></p>

<p>Gah! <em>I</em> used to be the brilliant one at Verba Retorta University, but ever since that damned Professor Wordberg showed up, there's been nothing but trouble. And it's all his confounded machine's fault!</p>

<p>He's a fraud &ndash; he has to be &ndash; I just needed enough evidence to prove it. So, last night, I... Look, it's not important how I got in there, but purely by happenstance, I found myself in Wordberg's lab after everyone else had left (and, as a tenured professor, I can assure you, I have every right to be there). Anyway, with no one else around, I took the opportunity to gather the proof I needed. I grabbed four words I happened to have in my pocket, loaded them up and started up his alleged "word transformation engine"...</p>

<p>Here's the video footage I took of the process (sorry for the poor quality, my phone's a little dated):</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uIJrT.gif"><img src="images/uIJrT.png" alt="The Rube Wordberg Machine"></a><br>
<sub>The words I put into the machine were <strong>smallscale</strong>, <strong>nosier</strong>, <strong>apron</strong>, and <strong>outputs</strong>.</sub></p>

<p>Anyway, after a lot of show, the machine's output was unceremoniously dropped into the bin at the bottom. But this is where things went wrong, and where I'm hoping you can help... The most obvious problem is that the machine <em>appears to have actually worked(!)</em>, but right now that's not my concern. The immediate issue is that there were already words in the bin at the bottom and I don't know which are mine and which were already there. To make matters worse, some of them have been broken in the fall, and again, I don't know if they're mine:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2dgBO.png"><img src="images/2dgBO.png" alt="bin of words"></a><br>
<sub>The words in the bin appear to be <strong>jerseys</strong>, <strong>tangible</strong>, <strong>pulse</strong>, <strong>newsletter</strong>, <strong>inputs</strong>, <strong>antonym</strong>, <strong>unpins</strong>, <strong>mustard</strong>, <strong>afford</strong>, and <strong>factory</strong>.</sub></p>

<p>Now, <em>under no circumstances</em> can Professor Wordberg know I was in here, so in order to hide the evidence, I need you to help me work out:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Which words from the bin are the, now transformed, words that I loaded in?</strong></li>
<li><strong>If either of the two broken words are <em>not</em> mine, what word can I put through the machine again to create an unbroken copy?</strong></li>
</ol>

  /<br><br>
  Curiosity killed the cat, so whatever you do, please don’t come and find me. You need to save your energy for the kids. Please just trust me, this is for the best. <br><br>
  Obviously, I think I’ll come back. But please be patient. I wouldn’t leave my family unless I had to. I’ll stay <em>hidden</em> until it’s safe to return. I’ve left no clues, that would be too dangerous.<br><br>
  Unexpectedly someone has come after me. I had to completely disappear very quickly indeed. I had time to write this <em>message</em> or try and call you. My phone was dead, you were out so I wrote this. Wow, I won’t forget that feeling of panic. Hopefully you can see I had no choice about leaving. It wasn’t me that chose to leave, I was forced. <br><br>
  Now again, I must tell you not to come and find me. <em>In</em> the case that you do, then the chances are you won’t find me. There’s zero clues which lead to me.  <br><br>
  Tell all the kids to be brave. I think that they’ll struggle and find it hard without a mother. And it’ll be my fault. I wish I could tell you my location so I could see you again.<br><br>
  Note I don’t want anyone knowing about this. Anyone that you call who asks, tell them I ran away, not the truth. And whatever you do don’t tell the police. <br><br>
  I would have stayed but I couldn’t have or I’d have been caught. The <em>first</em> thing that I did was to call a taxi. Then I think we must have hit a car, I'm sure I’ll sue the driver if I get a chance.<br><br>
  Never before had I been angrier. I couldn’t even get out of the car, and the state the back of it was in was unbelievable. I miss home so badly. If I could see it again, I really would do anything.<br><br>
   Even now, so far away, I love you and I’ll try and send <em>letters</em>. It’s you that I want to see again. I will come back as soon as possible. Try and find hope and some faith in that.<br><br>
  Love from me, <br><br>

  <p>How vitally important are the details of this verse;<br>
  examining them closely is the task to take on first.<br>
  And once they've been digested, one may feel the need to snooze;<br>
  now please reject that feeling and keep minding p's and q's.</p>
  
  <p>Time and time again, you need to squelch the urge to rush.<br>

  My friend, if every word's perused, your work is almost done!</p>
  
  <p>I know that all this vigilance may start to vex or chafe.<br>
  So here's a hint to help you out and keep you feeling safe:<br>
  Some people say that punctuation rules are absolute.<br>
  Ill-use of them is abject and quite low, there's no dispute.</p>
  
  <p>Now, as you keep perusing, you may find a common theme.<br>
  Getting down and dirty is the answer, it may seem.<br>

  Rush to do your job, and quiz specific aspects next.  </p>
  
  <p>Oh, lazy folk will squawk at grammar law misapplication,<br>

  so you'll obtain it straight right now, without any dilution:<br>
  you want a pair of words portraying you, my puzzling buddy!<br>
  And no quick fix can find it!  No, just vim and lots of study!   </p>
  
  <p>Zest is what you'll have to have as these two words you seek;<br>
  as said before, the phrase describes a quirky puzzle geek;<br>
  just make a guess, go check your work; you'll see if it is right;<br>
  for after all, it's sure that you'll excel; you're very bright!</p>
  
  <p>As fin'lly this verbose creation's coming to a close,<br>
  please acquiesce to take my thanks for suff'ring through my prose --<br>

<p>In 1980, a man lives on the 30th floor of his building. Every morning he wakes up, gets ready, kisses his wife, takes the elevator down to the first floor, and goes to work.  </p>

<p>One morning, he wakes up, gets ready, kisses his wife, and gets in the elevator, exactly as he always has done. The morning is exactly the same as any other morning, and no one else was in their apartment.  </p>

<p>The man is alone in the elevator and there are no windows in or visible from the elevator. Without receiving any  communication of any kind, or the man being in any danger of any harm, he begins crying when the elevator reaches the 12th floor, because he knows his wife has died.  </p>

<p>How is this possible?  </p>

<p>Notes (added later) to eliminate "too broad" answers: </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> His wife was alive when he left the apartment.<br>
 The man loved his wife, and would never harm her in any way.</p>

  <p> The man had a boring typical day job. No danger involved.

<h2><a name="question12995"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/12995">Five coloured doors, which leads to freedom?</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">83 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5373">Rand al'Thor#5373</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/11251">Spacemonkey#11251</a></p>

<p>You have been incarcerated in a high-security prison for several nefarious crimes which we need not go into here. The warden, being a kindly logician, offers you a single chance to escape. You are blindfolded and given a choice of five doors, one of which leads to freedom and the other four to prison cells. You know that the doors are red, blue, green, yellow, and white; they are evenly spaced, each 2 paces from the next; and you are standing in front of the middle one. There is a guard standing by each door, and <em>all five guards tell the truth</em> (weren't expecting that, were you?). They make the following statements:</p>

<ul>
<li>The red door is somewhere to the left of the door leading to freedom.</li>
<li>The blue door is not at either end.</li>
<li>The green door is 3 doors away from the door leading to freedom (2 doors between them).</li>
<li>The yellow door is adjacent to the door leading to freedom.</li>
<li>The white door is the middle one.</li>
</ul>

<p>To find out how many paces you need to take to which side in order to be standing in front of the door to freedom, you need to answer the following two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What is the order of the coloured doors, left to right?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Which colour of door leads to freedom?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You may assume that all statements made about "left" and "right" refer to <em>your</em> left and right.</p>

<p>(I found more or less this puzzle on the internet and thought it would be easy, but for some reason it's a fair bit harder than it looks!)</p>

<p>Looks like <a href="https://puzzling.meta.stackexchange.com/a/6160/36023">the community has spoken</a>.</p>

<p>With a heavy heart (as if), I have trapped @Deusovi behind a never repeating, fractally recursive, infinite, unsolvable labyrinth. To keep him busy, I added a couple of teleports.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/deCDk.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/deCDk.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p><strong>The green part of the maze contains a copy of the maze, scaled down so that it exactly fits.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>A teleport is connected to every teleport of the same size. And yes. A scaled down "big teleport" is exactly the same size as a "small teleport".</strong></p>

<p>Fun facts about this puzzle:</p>

<ul>
<li>The angle of the scaled-down copy is an irrational part of $\pi$, so the angle will never repeat.</li>

<h2><a name="question13303"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/13303">A hunt for long forgotten treasure ...but beware the pirate's curse!</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">80 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5208">Alconja#5208</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5208">Alconja#5208</a></p>

<p>I never really knew my uncle growing up. He seemed nice enough, but I got the sense from the distant, troubled look in his eyes that there was at least some truth to the rumours...</p>

<p>Years before I was born, his fishing trawler was lost at sea under mysterious circumstances. None of his crew survived, and when pressed, he'd just mutter something about a freak storm. What is known, is that he spent several weeks adrift and when found, he was near death, babbling incoherently about pirates, treasure, and curses.</p>

<p>Anyway, my uncle passed away a few months ago, and last week, out of the blue a lawyer showed up on my doorstep with a large box that was, for some unexplained reason, left to me in his will. The box's strange contents included piles of musty, leather bound books, old tattered maps, a small brass telescope, a compass that no longer worked... It was interesting, even a little mysterious, but mostly it just seemed like junk. However, as I flipped through an old book documenting the native flora of some isolated pacific island, a small map fell to the ground...</p>

<hr>

<p>As you can see below, the map is hand drawn and shows the features of an unnamed island in exquisite detail:</p>

<p><img src="images/zaDz9.png" alt="hand drawn map"></p>

<p>More interestingly, however, is the strange riddle scrawled on the back in a delicate, spidery script:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Start your search from dead man's cave and follow the clues herein.</em><br>
  <em>Sharpen a sword and your wits and you're ready to begin.</em>  </p>
  
  <p><em>Paired up, pared down, the truth exposed, lies within lies.</em><br>
  <em>Heading onwards north, reeling seas terrorize.</em>  </p>
  
  <p><em>Right is left and left is right, turn and go until,</em><br>
  <em>Twins appear to mark an end, though you'll continue still.</em>  </p>
  
  <p><em>Cardinals sitting in their nests, pick them up one by one.</em><br>
  <em>Set them free and follow them, then turn to what's undone.</em>  </p>
  
  <p><em>A leap of faith, surrender yourself. But when things come to a head,</em><br>
  <em>Take the easy way out, with the blues left behind, go three and don't retread.</em>  </p>
  
  <p><em>Follow the gaze of the crimson saint as he looks to the pre-dawn glow.</em><br>
  <em>The distance the crow flies in to pi, hints how far to go.</em>  </p>
  
  <p><em>Two one fives, all lined up, this time point the way.</em><br>
  <em>They also indicate how far. Go now or be led astray.</em>  </p>
  
  <p><em>Proceed until, when viewed from on high, the island itself gives a sign.</em><br>
  <em>Next steps revealed as the river reflects and the ancient stones align.</em>  </p>
  
  <p><em>Run forth with what you carry. Confusion becomes clear.</em><br>
  <em>Now piece together your reward, you'll find it buried here.</em>  </p>
  
  <p><em>Be warned though treasure seeker, should you make but one wrong turn.</em><br>
  <em>The pirate's curse, and certain death, is all that you will earn...</em>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's not totally clear, but I'm pretty certain the riddle and map indicate some long forgotten pirate's treasure! Unfortunately, I've been unable to decipher any of it, and perhaps subconsciously I don't want to find the answer myself, for fear of the fate that befell my uncle and his crew... Either way, I've decided I'm turning it over to you. Good luck, but beware the pirate's curse...</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Clarifications</strong></p>

<p>To be 100% clear:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everything you need to solve this puzzle, beyond a little general knowledge, is contained in the map and riddle, the rest is just flavor text.</li>
<li>The last stanza is also just flavor, but the rest contain one or more discrete directions.</li>
<li>You can assume that you're capable of crossing rivers, climbing mountains, swimming in the ocean, etc. Basically all squares on the map are valid, but you'll never be directed off the map completely.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, if you want to keep your working to yourself initially (this is a race for the treasure after all!), feel free to just post <strong>in the comments</strong>, the coordinates you arrived at at the end of each stanza, with the last being the location of the treasure, along with what the treasure actually is. Eg. "<em>AB, CD, ..., YZ - Treasure is a pile of gold</em>". I'll then give a percentage indication of how successful you were. (obviously, when giving an actual answer, you'll need to justify those steps with valid logic though).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Hints</strong><br>
<sup><em>(This puzzle is now solved, but I'll leave these here for prosperity, or for late comers who still want to work through the challenge)</em></sup></p>

<p>General hints:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>1</strong>: As @Realdeo has observed in the comments, you can't necessarily assume North is up. Maybe there's a way to confirm...<br>
 <strong>2</strong>: Don't bother looking for a clue that will tell you where dead man's cave is. Just pick a cave and start. It will become apparent as you progress if you made the right choice...<br>
 <strong>3</strong>: Almost all the stanzas are effectively standalone riddles, so if you get stuck on one you can still work on others. Though you should still be aware that sometimes things rely on you being in a specific location in order to make sense (even then, you will likely be able to "solve" and understand the stanza). Of the individual stanzas/riddles, some are wordplay, some are mini puzzles, some use the map and some are fairly direct (though muddied with metaphor).<br>
 <strong>4</strong>: No clue will ever explicitly tell you to travel diagonally or any other non-orthogonal direction. Though some stanzas will be made up of multiple individual (orthogonal) steps, making the overall movement for the stanza non-orthogonal.<br>
 <strong>5</strong>: Don't bother trying to decrypt or decode all the letters around the edge. You won't get very far, as more than half are just random fillers. You'll need certain letters at some point, but hopefully when the time comes, you'll know which ones...<br>
 <strong>6</strong>: It will make your life easier if the first thing you do is to determine where north is. You can do this before even looking at the riddle.<br>
 <strong>7</strong>: Incorporating clues given on @rand's attempt at finding North: Paying close attention to the blotches around the compass rose is a captital idea! Plus, I'm sure the pirates would have put one on all four sides if they could have, but for some reason only three have anything visible... What could make those blotches, and why would only one side not have any? ...also, perhaps it's worth thinking about what's NOT there.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stanza specific hints:  </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>Start your search</strong>: This stanza is mostly just a direct statement, so for the moment, there's not much to be gained puzzling over it (see general hint about dead man's cave above).<br>
 <strong>Paired up</strong>: The first line is the most important here, as it will help to understand the second.<br>
 <strong>Paired up</strong>: To clarify the hint above, although the first line is key, both lines still need to be used together. If the first is the key, then the second is the lock.<br>
 <strong>Paired up</strong>: You don't need to look at the map for this one, just read it very carefully, every single word should make sense once you get it.<br>
 <strong>Paired up</strong>: The solution to this stanza will be a clear, but short, sentence with a form similar to "head two north"<br>
 <strong>Paired up</strong>: People have correctly realised that there is wordplay involved here... However, beyond some slightly awkward grammar, the first line is quite literal in terms of what you need to do.<br>
 <strong>Right is left</strong>: Where you are on the map matters for this one.<br>
 <strong>Right is left</strong>: In response to @rps asking if the twins were the <code>II</code> coordinates - there's multiple possible "twins" on the map with the correct ones being validated by your movement. If you know which way north is and you've solved stanza 2, <del>you should be able to deduce/validate both dead man's cave &amp; the twins</del>.<br>
 <strong>Right is left</strong>: I slightly overstated myself in the hint above (apologies, though I doubt it sent anyone too far off track), you won't be able to 100% validate the twins and dead man's cave yet, but you will be able to narrow it down to two possibilities (one of which you'll be able to discount later).<br>
 <strong>Right is left</strong>: How would a pirate "mark and end" (particularly when we're talking about a treasure map)?<br>
 <strong>Right is left</strong>: Obviously I've made the twins a bit subtle, so when you're looking for them, consider squares as whole units... also, a pirate would need more than one set of twins to mark a spot...<br>
 <strong>Cardinals</strong>: Make sure you only free the cardinals that are actually in their nests, no others. If you get that far, what's undone should be clear.<br>
 <strong>A leap of faith</strong>: Metaphor and the map.<br>
 <strong>A leap of faith</strong>: Where you're standing and which way you're facing matter a lot here. If it makes no sense to you, you're probably standing in the wrong spot.<br>
 <strong>A leap of faith</strong>: There are multiple individual steps, but the instructions are all fairly direct (mostly just metaphor with some minor play on words, but no "tricks" like the "paired up" stanza), just make sure those blues are actually left behind when you follow the last step.<br>
 <strong>Follow the gaze</strong>: Who might the crimson saint be?<br>
 <strong>Follow the gaze</strong>: You'll need some very basic (high school level?) maths here, but currently you've almost certainly got it wrong...<br>
 <strong>Follow the gaze</strong>: The distance to go will be an integer value, with no rounding or approximating required.<br>
 <strong>Two one fives</strong>: "Two one fives" are the key here, but there are several other hints in this stanza to push you in the right direction.<br>
 <strong>Two one fives</strong>: How could "two one fives" be interpreted given the pluralisation?<br>
 <strong>Two one fives</strong>: Although "two one fives" is the key clue, the other sentence fragments are still hints. Ask yourself why I would phrase the rest of it the way I have...<br>
 <strong>Proceed until</strong>: First line is a simple directive, the second points to a mini puzzle of its own.<br>
 <strong>Run forth</strong>: What are you carrying?<br>
 <strong>Run forth</strong>: The first line is your last direction clue, the second line is talking about the treasure itself.<br>
 <strong>Run forth</strong>: "Confusion becomes clear" can be applied to the first sentence or the second line equally (and I've been dropping many hints to various people on how to discover what the treasure is).<br>
 <strong>Be warned</strong>: As stated in the clarifications, you can completely ignore this stanza.  </p>

<p><strong>Fallen heroes</strong></p>

<p>A memorial to those who were lost to the pirate's curse:</p>

<ul>
<li>Realdeo attempted <code>HT TG ES EN ES MU EI HN HS</code>, but those co-ordinates clearly spell out "THE NEMESIS HUNTS (geh)", which can't be a good sign... (with approximately 2% correct, he is now missing, presumed dead)</li>
<li>tfitzger tried <code>UE IE II SR...</code>, but luckily gave up as he had almost spelled out "[c]URSE" already! (with maybe 20% right of the 20% attempted, I can only hope he escaped the curse, but it's not looking good)

<ul>
<li>It's a miracle. He's alive and still searching, with a second attempt of <code>UE IE II CU AE...</code>. Going from "[c]URSE" to "CU[rs]E" is an improvement, but I still have my concerns.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Timur Kuchkarov has made a cautious start of <code>FE FI II...</code>, but with a low percentage correct, the "FIE" upon him may grow to something much worse.</li>
<li>After various attempts, rand al'thor settled on <code>HT DT DO EN EB EU HU RY RI</code>, but I'm worried for his safety given that the pirates seem to be trying to tell him "R! You be hurt, then died!" (grammar has never been a pirate's strong point).

<ul>
<li>It seems rand al'thor is made of tougher stuff than I thought... he survived the pirate's death threats, to find the treasure!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>A classic:</p>

<p>A CEO of a multi-million dollar business has to go on a business trip to Belgium (from somewhere in America).
Before going to the airport in the morning with his limousine, he's going to the office first to get some files that he forgot the previous night. </p>

<p>When arriving at the office, the night guard opens the gate &amp; door for him.
The CEO gets the files and drinks a coffee while chatting a bit with the guard, and he mentions that he's flying to Belgium today for a deal he cannot miss, it would bring millions of dollars to the business. </p>

<p>The night guard looks shocked, and explains why.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Guard</strong>: <em>I just had a dream this night. A plane that would fly to Belgium is going to crash in the middle of the Ocean.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The night guard begs his CEO not to go on this business trip.
And the CEO believes him. He doesn't go to the airport and cancels his flight.
Later that day, on the news, an air-plane crash... 
It was the plane that flew to Belgium. It crashed in the middle of the ocean.</p>

<p>The CEO thanks the night guard later and gives him $10.000.<br>
The CEO also tells the night guard that he's fired.</p>

<p>Jason,</p>

<p>You asked me to email you the information that we talked about, earlier, so that we had a record of it.</p>

<p>Some updates.  There was a hidden message in the letter that stated: "Helps us figure out the clue key is understand".  You're definitely going to want to work under the assumption that this is a kidnapping matter, at this point.  We'll work, further, to see if that key means anything useful, or not.</p>

<p>We also noticed that strange discrepancy, that I mentioned earlier, with the name of the image that his wife sent him.  The email stated that it had a specific name, but when we dug down into the server, it really had a different one.  I don't know that it matters, but I went ahead and modified the text, down in this email thread, so that we can reference it, later.</p>

<p>Also (which you know, since you came to see me), we spent several hours trying to figure out if the image that he sent means anything and, quite honestly, we came up blank.  I'm not sure if it will really provide us any insight, but we will, of course, keep looking, just in case I am wrong.</p>

<p>Please check into it, ASAP, and let me know if you guys find anything suspicious going on here.  The rest of my team is not around; I've forwarded the entire thread to you, so that you can understand why I'm concerned.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you can figure out what's really going on, and if there's someone that I need to be looking for or if she legitimately left him.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>
&dash; Jason</p>

  <p>Dear Sam,</p>
  
  <p>I just wanted to write this letter, in the hopes that it he𝚕ps you to know why me and the kids are gone.  It's not about you.  It's about uѕ.  We really just need to find a way to fiɡure out how to work things o𝚞t.  Sometimes, I just think that t𝗁e problem must be that you really haven't a clu𝖾, but maybe it's me.  Maybe I'm the problem.</p>
  
  <p>Please remember that I do love you, and that's really the 𝗄ey to any relationship.  I hope this i𐑈 only temporary, and that we can come back soon, but I feel that it is entirely up to you.  Remember where we wanted to go?  I sent an image to remind you.  Please try to unⅾerstand and I will contact you in a week.  We'll take things bit by bit, but try to, at least, understand how significant this is for me.</p>

<p>Whoa.  Slow down, Sam.  There's a reason that the police hold off on these kind of things.  No, I haven't seen Karen.  She didn't come in to work, this morning, either, but neither did Kyle, Jim, or the rest of my team, so he may have them off doing something that I wasn't told about, yet.  Try to calm down, and let me know if you hear from her, soon.  I'll keep an eye on my email, in case you hear anything.  </p>

<p>Don't worry about the personal matters issue.  I'll deal with that.  She is my partner, remember.</p>

<p>"<em>Each mirror is a world of it's own</em>," Joe explains.<br>
"<i>Joe, that's bulls***! Mirrors are just mirrors!</i>" Rita proclaims.</p>

<p><strong>Joe proceeds to lay out the following</strong>~</p>

<p>$10~Laws~of~Mirror~Universes$</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><strong>Law of Rotation:</strong> For each <strong>one</strong> orientation of a mirror (rotated spherically or in 3D space) there
  is exactly <strong>one</strong> universe perfectly symmetrical to our own.</li>
  <li><strong>Law of Quantity:</strong> There are infinite orientations possible in a sphere, so there are <strong>infinite</strong> universes parallel to our own. (<em>Sidenote: Why not just have one mirror universe? Why do we need infinite parallel ones? Because moving an entire universe when you pick up a mirror seems like a lot more work then connecting to a bunch of other ones</em>)</li>
  <li><strong>Law of Non-Uniqueness:</strong> Every universe began at the same time and progressed in the exact same way, with the exception of being "flipped" as we observe in a
  reflection. That means <strong>we are nothing special</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Law of Boundaries:</strong> The <strong>line of symmetry</strong> in each case is <strong>defined by the mirror</strong> itself.</li>
  <li><strong>Law of Congruent Copies:</strong> Changing the orientation of a mirror links to another exact replica of that mirror universe - they are all <a href="http://ceemrr.com/Geometry1/Transitive/Transitive_print.html" rel="noreferrer">congruent to each
  other through transitivity</a></li>
  <li><strong>Law of Interaction:</strong> We cannot exchange matter into these universes because for every <strong>one</strong> particle that attempts to cross the threshhold, exactly <strong>one</strong> congruent particle meets it at the barrier.</li>
  <li><strong>Law of Weak Reflectional Attraction:</strong> A weak force along the mirror accounts for substances "stuck" to each other across the threshhold. This is why mirrors can be dirty: the boundary has a slight pull that makes dirt, etc stay on the plane of the mirror instead of falling as if there was simply air.</li>
  <li><strong>Law of Rigidity and Flatness:</strong> Boundaries such as funhouse mirrors or reflections in water serve only as distorted windows; they must be flat and rigid to allow
  actual interaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Law of Heat Transfer:</strong> The <strong>medium</strong> of the mirror (metal, etc) <strong>moderates heat</strong> transfer, which is why you don't feel immediate warmth when you touch
  a mirror with your hand.</li>
  <li><strong>Law of Medium Maintenance:</strong> That which would break the mirror surface due to pressure or momentum will do so <strong>before</strong> trying to pass through. Each new shard is its own boundary.</li>
  </ol>

<p>"<em>Joe</em>," says Rita, "<em>Your 'theory' doesn't account for</em> this."<br>
Rita picks up a <strong>household object</strong> and demonstrates why mirrors are simple reflections of light, and nothing more.</p>

<p>Her demonstration produces results that would be <em>different</em> if there were multiple, congruent universes bound by mirrors (for example hitting the mirror with something that should have gone through if there were actually an alternative universe on the other side)</p>

<p>One night nine gangsters stole a gold bar. When the time came for dividing the bar, they faced a problem: two of the criminals put guns to each other's faces. Now it's up to fate whether one of them lives, they both live or both die.</p>

<p>While these two are dealing with each other, the others decide to continue dividing the gold bar. What is the minimal amount of pieces they should divide the bar into, so that no matter how things pan out, everyone can be given an equal share?</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 1</strong>:  Both gangsters blow each other's brains out.  The gold must be divided evenly among the seven remaining gangsters.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 2</strong>:  One gangster is quicker on the draw, and manages to take out his opponent.  The gold must be divided evenly among the eight remaining gangsters.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 3</strong>:  The duelling gangsters discuss their differences, come to a mutually beneficial agreement, and put away their guns.  The gold must be divided evenly among all nine gangsters.</p>

<p><img src="images/PwPQx.png" alt="PZL-SE-11R"></p>

<p>I'm going to come right out and say it: I'm kinda bored of making puzzles, but I still want those sweet, sweet imaginary internet points, so I'm phoning it in this time with a flat-pack rebus I bought at a puzzle warehouse. The only thing is, I can't really be bothered putting it together... Rather than completely waste my money though, I'm just posting it here, in case someone else wants to finish building it.</p>

<p>Above is a bog standard PZL-SE-11R puzzle socket that this rebus is compatible with (as I'm sure you've seen a million times before), and below are the instructions... Underneath that, are the puzzle components themselves.</p>

<h4>Instructions:</h4>

<p><img src="images/9XxiF.png" alt="Instructions"></p>

<h4>Components:</h4>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I already opened the puzzle, and discarded the packaging. The parts came as a pair of cubes, which opened out, ready to slot into the socket up the top (I think the makers have misunderstood the flat-pack concept). The cube that's in two pieces didn't break, but just came apart as it unfolded. I didn't pay attention to where it was originally joined, but I'm sure it won't make much difference...</p>

<p><img src="images/8ztTJ.png" alt="Components"></p>

<p>So, yeah... Feel free to finish putting it together, and then solve the resulting rebus.</p>

<p>Or not... Whatever...</p>

<h2><a name="question7701"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/7701">10 Prisoners, 10 Keys, and 7 Years</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">71 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/4765">Milo Brandt#4765</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/8739">keymaster#8739</a></p>

<p>One day, the warden of a prison is, like most wardens in puzzles, feeling a little bit capricious and decides that he wants to get rid of his prisoners, one way or another. He gathers all the prisoners in the yard and explains to them - "Tonight, I will go to each of you, hand you a key, and tell you who has your key. Each day after that, while the others are out of the cells and no one is watching, I will allow each of you to place your key in someone else's cell - and each night, you may collect the keys in your own cell. If, at any point, you are certain that everyone has the key to their own cell, you may summon me, at which point each of you will open your own cell and walk free. If anyone has the wrong key, everyone will be executed then and there. You may discuss your strategy before tonight, but afterwards no communication will be allowed regarding my game. - Oh, and by the way, if you are still here seven years from today, I will execute everyone - it'll be a big birthday for me and I want to retire!"</p>

<p>That night, just as promised, the warden went to each cell and gave each prisoner a key. As he handed each prisoner the key, he whispered to them the name of the person possessing the key to their cell. The keys were entirely indistinguishable from one another, but that was okay, because the prisoners had not counted on being able to tell anything about them. Indeed, the prisoners all seemed confident.</p>

<p>Each day for the nearly seven years, the prisoners all anonymously gave the key in their possession to someone else. Then, hardly a month before the deadline, a prisoner shouted to the warden that they were ready. All the prisoners were certain that they would live, and, lo and behold, when they put the keys in the locks to their cells, every cell opened.</p>

<p>What was their strategy? Exactly how many days did it take?</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong></p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> The warden had learned this from his own days as a prisoner, when the same challenge was issued to him and just two other prisoners. It took only six days of trading keys before they were released.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Oops, turns out my prisoners were kind of dumb in their choice of strategy. (If anyone wants to puzzle out what I was thinking of, the information in the post about <em>should</em> be sufficient - but I consider the puzzle, and this question to more about the most efficient way to do it). The prisoners, if wise, can be free in less than a fortnight.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jack is looking at Anne, but Anne is looking at George. Jack is married, but George is not. Is a married person looking at an unmarried person?</p>

<h2><a name="question455"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/455">Why does this solution guarantee that the prince knocks on the right door to find the princess?</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">67 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/10">WendiKidd#10</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/320">CaptainRad#320</a></p>

<p>I found this puzzle <a href="http://www.folj.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=12849">online</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the top floor of a castle lives a princess. The floor has 17 bedrooms arranged in a row. Each bedroom has doors connecting to the adjoining bedrooms as well as to the outside corridor. The princess sleeps in a different bedroom each night by opening the door to an adjoining bedroom and spending the night and the next day in that room. </p>
  
  <p>One day a prince arrives at the castle and is desirous of marrying the princess. The guardian angel at the castle tells him of the princess' sleeping patterns and informs him that each morning he may knock on one of the outside doors. If the princess happens to be behind that door, she will open it and consent to marry him. The prince also has a return ticket to his kingdom in 30 days, so he can make at most 30 attempts. Can the prince win the hand of the princess, and if so, what is his strategy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An unstated assumption here is that the princess can move to <em>any</em> adjacent room (she's not restricted to moving in one direction). So a possible sequence could be 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2... </p>

<p>Further down the thread at the link, this solution is given:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Prince should knock on the second door from one of the ends of the corridor (call it door #2), and knock on the next adjacent door each successive day until he reaches the second door from the opposite end of the corridor (door #16). The day after that, he should begin the same process in reverse order (meaning he will knock on the 16th door two days in a row). By the time he reaches his starting point (door #2 on the 30th day), he will have found the princess. </p>
  
  <p>Number the doors 1 thru 17.<br>
  If the princess occupies an even numbered room on the day the prince first knocks on a door (#2), then she will either occupy the same room he knocks on or she will be an even number of rooms away. Since both move to an adjacent room each day, this will hold true so she will never be in a room adjacent to the one he knocks on, and thus never be in a position to move past him the next day. She will have nowhere else to go by the time he reaches the 16th door, and will have by then been located. If she, on the other hand, was in an odd numbered room when he began, then she will be in an even numbered room when the prince starts the process again on day 16 (when he knocks on door #16 the second time).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've been trying to follow the solution, but I don't quite get it. The main assumption the logic in the solution seems to hinge on is this: <strong>"she will never be in a room adjacent to the one he knocks on, and thus never be in a position to move past him the next day."</strong> I can't figure out what evidence from the puzzle supports that assumption. If we begin knocking at door #2 and the princess is in room #3, our next move (following this solution) will be to knock on door #3. But at this point the princess could have moved to room #2, and we will keep moving to higher numbered rooms, and the princess could easily remain in the lower-numbered rooms. </p>

<p>So I'm having trouble understanding why this is the solution. Can someone explain it more clearly/in a different manner? Why will this process ensure the princess is found?</p>

<h2><a name="question12119"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/12119">Coin Flipping Game with the Devil</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">65 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/10615">Mike Earnest#10615</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/1752">Lopsy#1752</a></p>

<p>You die, and awake in Hell. Satan awaits you, and has prepared a curious game. He has arranged $n$ quarters in a line, going in the east/west direction. He placed the coins at the ends tails up, and all others heads up, like so:
$$
\text{T H H H }\cdots \text{ H H H T}
$$</p>

<p>Satan explains the rules.</p>

<ul>
<li>Once a day, a coin is removed from the east end, and placed on the west end.
<ul>
<li>If the coin was initially tails-up, then <em>you</em> get to choose whether the coin is placed heads up or down.</li>
<li>If it was initially heads-up, then Satan gets to make this choice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If the coins are all heads up at the end of a day, you get to leave Hell.</li>
</ul>

<p>Satan will of course try his hardest to make sure you never leave.</p>

<p>For example, when $n=5$, we start with $\text{T H H } \color{red}{\text H} \color{green}{\text{ T}}$. The first day is your choice; if you choose heads, the arrangement becomes $\color{green}{\text{H }}\text{T H H } \color{red}{\text H} $. The next three days, however, will be Satan's choice. He may fight back on the second day by choosing tails, resulting in $\color{red}{\text{T } }\color{green}{\text{H }}\text{T H H }  $.</p>

<p>Is there a strategy that eventually guarantees your salvation? Or can Satan conspire to keep you in Hell forever? </p>

<p>Alice is in the most puzzling part of Wonderland yet. Following the white rabbit, she emerged found herself in the middle of a hedge maze. The rabbit provided her with a map before scurrying off, but it only seemed to make her more confused. She needs your help to figure out how to escape the maze.</p>

<p>The maze has 12 potential exits, numbered on the map. Each of the squares labeled A, B, C and D represent <strong>smaller copies of the entire maze</strong>. These submazes each have their own submazes, like infinitely many nested Matryoshka dolls, except that every doll has four dolls nested inside it.  </p>

<p>Below the map is a bird's eye view of the actual maze, where you can see how the passages become smaller and smaller in a fractal fashion (only three levels of recursion are actually pictured). Fortunately, Alice has an ample supply of cakes and elixirs to change her size as necessary. </p>

<p>One last note: the little orange curve between B and D is a bridge which can be crossed over and walked under, but jumping from the bridge to the path below is not allowed.  </p>

<p>You are a prisoner in a room with 2 doors and 2 guards. One of the doors will guide you to freedom and behind the other is a hangman --you don't know which is which.</p>

<p>One of the guards always tells the truth and the other always lies. You don't know which one is the truth-teller or the liar either.</p>

<p>You have to choose and open one of these doors, but you can only ask a single question to one of the guards.</p>

<p>What do you ask so you can pick the door to freedom?</p>

<p>The town of Squareshire has six streets: four sides of a square and the lines joining the midpoints of opposite sides.</p>

<p>$\hskip2in$<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/odSRh.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/odSRh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>A policeman is chasing a thief along these streets. If they are ever on the same street, then the policeman can shoot the thief. The policeman runs slightly faster than twice the thief (say 2.0001 times the speed of the thief). How can he shoot the thief?</p>

<p><em>Source: Moscow mathematical Olympiad, 1978</em></p>

<h3>Clarification:</h3>

<p>The squares between the streets contain houses and walls, so the policeman can't see the thief unless they're on the same street. He has no idea about the exact location and strategy used by the thief.  </p>

<p>For obvious reasons, Bob was rather confused for a while. He realized that in their entire conversation she had never said her name. </p>

<p>All the same, he began trying to figure out the message she had written him. He was beginning to despair but then as he finished working out what she had written him, he immediately knew her name and called her number the first chance he got.</p>

He sits alone in an opulent palace, never moving, never blinking, allowing each visitor to ask <em>one</em> question of him. You take a moment to catch your breath after climbing the steps to his throne, gather yourself, and ask:</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of life?"</p>

<p>You were told that he would answer one question for each person, and this question has been nagging on your mind.</p>

<p>What you were <em>not</em> told is that his answers were not quite straightforward.</p>

<p>As he begins to speak, you scramble to grab your notepad and begin writing. At the end of his message to you, you read back what he's said. "What?", you ask out loud, audibly confused.</p>

<p>Of course, The Oracle does not answer.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>To start, stay within the pathway of general glee,<br>
though stay clear of the law faery, who flits about wildly.</em>  </p>

<p><em>The road third-least taken leads to you and I in flight.<br>
Head north 'til you see the reverse, then once more north to the burial site.</em></p>

<p><em>When five becomes square, it may lead to confusion;<br>
behead the basilisk, an ironic inclusion.</em></p>

<p><em>Before two sharp curves and the ring of sorcery,<br>
stand still, close your eyes, and count aloud past three.</em></p>

<p><em>In the air - do you hear it? The water baby screams.<br>
Let our own misgivings start and end in our dreams.</em></p>

<p><em>A quixotic elf and I stand at the gates -<br>
succumb to the virus, and the city awaits.</em></p>

<p><em>As you approach the arbor, I wait in between.<br>
Clutch your keepsake as the first enemy's heard and seen.</em></p>

<p><em>Will being stuck in all this goo truly help you see?<br>
Primarily, primarily; whip around, forcefully.</em></p>

<p><em>Between the lines you'll find your answer, definitively twisted;<br>
yet in the shadows aligned so clearly you'll be surprised you missed it.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Can you discover the meaning of life from The Oracle's message?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>HINT 1:</strong></p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> The Oracle speaks quite cryptically, don't you think? <em>(I've added a new tag to the puzzle that should add some clarification to it. Hopefully that should give you some idea as to how the puzzle should be solved - and more importantly, some knowledge on how it shouldn't.)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>HINT 2:</strong></p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> The two most important words to figuring out this puzzle's big gimmick are "definitively twisted". </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Stanza-Specific Hints:</strong></p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>Stanza 1:</strong> This couplet gives you a key cryptic crossword indicator, but don't get caught up on the result making any sense. In fact, the couplet tells you exactly which words to use and which to avoid. Keep in mind somewhere in there is a definition!<br>
 <strong>Stanza 2:</strong> Pretty much everyone has identified 'u' and 'i' from this couplet, and you're all on the right track. Most of the words in this couplet aren't indicative of words, <em>per se.</em><br>
 <strong>Stanza 3:</strong> If five becoming square actually meant the number 25, that wouldn't lead to confusion at all, would it? Harry Potter's version of the basilisk is not the only one out there.<br>
 <strong>Stanza 4:</strong> The last number reference leads to confusion. This one does not. Make sure you're counting aloud. To figure out the rest of the couplet, getting out a pen and paper and illustrating might help.<br>
 <strong>Stanza 5:</strong> I already mentioned that 'in our dreams' is just in this couplet as a rhyming mechanism. There's only one other place where I do that, and I'll identify it. The cryptic here has already been solved. Which words weren't part of it? Those may help you with another stanza...<br>
 <strong>Stanza 6:</strong> This one is a fairly straightforward clue. Open your cryptic-solving mind, remember the gimmick of the puzzle, and look for a keyword or two to get things going.<br>
 <strong>Stanza 7:</strong> You already know at least one word here that doesn't belong with this couplet. The rest of the couplet should be easily solvable, especially if you don't worry about the definition until you solve the cryptic.<br>
 <strong>Stanza 8:</strong> Will 'truly help you see' truly help you see? Not really.<br>
 <strong>Stanza 9:</strong> The first line means two things. You already know what 'definitively twisted' means, which is a good start. 'In the shadows' is a reference to the cryptic clues, which are apparently aligned <em>so</em> clearly! I'm surprised you missed it.<br>
<br>
 <strong>All stanzas:</strong> You will find pretty quickly that the words all share a specific property. It's not an obscure property, either (I promise).<br>
 <strong>All stanzas:</strong> The best way to approach this puzzle is to solve a stanza's cryptic clue, find its definition, then solve <em>that</em> stanza's cryptic clue with the words in the previous stanza's definition excluded (obviously); lather, rinse, repeat. Luckily, you've already been given a head-start with both a cryptic clue solved and its definition identified.</p>

If I feel they don't give too much of the puzzle away, I'll be happy to answer them.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>6/15/2015 Update:</strong> 2 days left on the bounty - someone better solve this! <strong>Pete</strong> and <strong>Fillet</strong> have given you all you need to work with. I can also conclusively tell you that the ninth stanza is specifically instructions, rather than another clue to the puzzle. Once again, I'm happy to answer any questions! <em>(I've also added stanza-specific hints, in hopes that one or two might kickstart the solution to this puzzle.)</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>6/16/2015 Update:</strong> Hopefully this will be the last time I update this puzzle! I just want to note that partial answers are totally awesome for this puzzle.

<a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/36256/this-is-it-this-is-the-one-find-your-wife">You now know where your wife is</a>, so you hop on a plane and fly over to France. You reach the house and burst through the front door, only to find the house deserted. In despair, you slump into a chair in the kitchen. You then notice a note pinned to the table in front of you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To xxxxx,</p>
  
  <p>/</p>
  
  <p>Now it seems you misunderstood me, despite my letters to you. I don’t need any help, although I’m happy you came. I told you to please not come looking, but it appears you have anyway. Honestly, again, you have to return.</p>
  
  <p>I’ve been forced to disappear. You must go back to the family to make them see. Make sure you <em>check</em> on the kids, and do not forget, before going home.</p>
  
  <p>Care for my family. This will not be easy for them to take. Tell them I was hiding after being afraid someone was coming, and that I ran. I was scared, but over time <em>the</em> fear reduced and I became less and less cautious so I then left my carers when things got out of hand. When I heard you were coming to find me before trying to save me I had to return to them and to hiding. We couldn’t afford to meet.</p>
  
  <p>Enough of that, I don’t have much more time to write each of these letters. This, with life having gone into reverse, I expect will be my <em>last</em> letter to you. But I hope that sometime I can, you have my word, come back.</p>
  
  <p>Think of me often and hope our next meeting is soon. Our relationship was just absolutely unimaginable, the best possible, I thank you a lot for that of course. I really am extremely thankful, our life was first class and fantastic.</p>
  
  <p>Really must hurry now, can’t say the reason why but I really have to go. To be truthful there’s so much more I want to say to you but I can’t, for one thing that’s straight forward - my dinner’s going cold. So’s my tea.</p>
  
  <p>You can move but will always, and hopefully one day once again can be my husband, you know that already without these words. Remember I love you. This is one of, or the hardest thing I probably have ever done, I’m short of breath, trying not to get tear drops over these <em>letters</em>, or even worst and the very thing I want last, over my writing. It’s really hard not to sob.</p>

  <p>Love from me,</p>

<p>Realising that your wife may be here after all you get up and look in the next room to find a page of what appears to be algebra. You also <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16WbfElgUrSNUChd88JI6bf8Uc_j1hrviHkehEeeNN1E/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noreferrer">put it in a spreadsheet</a> so its easier to look at, though the formating isn't as good.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GmT2Y.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/GmT2Y.png" alt="updated algebra"></a></p>

<p>Expecting more, you go upstairs and find a page ripped from a book. You take a glance at it. It seems to be from Great Expectations by Charles Dickens, but you suspect the letters themselves are more important than the book...</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g6216.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/g6216.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>And lastly you find a load of supposingly meaningless letters scrawled on the wall upstairs. You write them down:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Smi semo dllam olive sr etirp,<br>

<p>There's a cool new cybercafé in town called <code>#DECAFE</code></p>

<p>The café charges a fee to use their computers, but if you BYOC (bring your own computer) you can get on their internet free with any purchase... if you know how!</p>

<p>After you pay, the cashier says a sentence. If you reply with the correct number, they will hand you a slip with credentials.</p>

<p>You eavesdrop as the four people in front of you acquire internet credentials:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cashier:</strong> Aloof whale swim forth.<br>
  <strong>Customer #1:</strong> One</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cashier:</strong> Tasty warm pasties contain stuff.<br>
  <strong>Customer #2:</strong> Two</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cashier:</strong> Pinkish fish adds distinct flavour on your bagel: robust smack.<br>
  <strong>Customer #3:</strong> Three</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, you figure it's easy enough, but then you're thrown for a loop when the next number is not four.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cashier:</strong> Toxic frogs dispatch.<br>
  <strong>Customer #4:</strong> Sixty</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After you've made your purchase, the cashier says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our cat can lick ice, you know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What number must you say to obtain internet credentials?</strong></p>

<h4>Clarification</h4>

<p>The challenge-response format is just intended to be a fun wrapper (and to make solving the puzzle easier by providing explicit known hidden messages): the challenges conceal the appropriate responses plainly using steganographic methods.</p>

<h4>Hints</h4>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <code>#DECAFE</code> <em>is</em> a color as pointed out in the comments, but that's not what counts.</p>

  <p> Every <em>word</em> is important, but only a handful of <em>letters</em> are meaningful.</p>

</blockquote>



<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> The cat could also pour ale without changing your answer. Similarly, the pasties could also contain pilaf, but not meats. Moreover, the whale could instead be a goose or a drake or <em>possibly</em> a manatee, but not an otter or a squid.</p>

<h2><a name="question17510"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/17510">The Jeweller's Dilemma</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">56 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5373">Rand al'Thor#5373</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/4551">xnor#4551</a></p>

<p>You are well known as the best jeweller in Puzzovania; your shop is always well stocked and your pockets are always bulging.</p>

<p>One day, the local 'godfather' of Puzzovania's organised crime comes into your shop. Naturally, you owe him a favour - who doesn't in these parts? He hands you a diamond the size of a hen's egg and tells you what he requires from you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"This is for my daughter. She's getting married - you understand? I want her to have the best-cut diamond in the whole of Puzzovania. It's family honour."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You nod mutely, inspecting the diamond in awe. It's the biggest one you've ever seen. You decide it would be more prudent not to ask where the diamond came from.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"So listen, my friend. The diamond needs to be cut to the shape of a <strong>convex polyhedron</strong>. Any size and shape; that doesn't matter. What matters is that <strong>every face of the polyhedron needs to have a different number of sides</strong>. My daughter's such a changeable character - never quite the same person twice. I want her jewel to reflect that. Do you think you can manage that for me?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Of ... of course, Godfather," you stammer. Once that imposing gentleman has taken his leave, you sit down, still holding the diamond, and wonder how you're going to do it. You need to call in a mathematician ... or possibly a puzzler!</p>

<p><strong>Can you satisfy the Godfather's wishes?</strong> If so, construct a polyhedron as required (and prepare your best suit, since he'll probably invite you to the wedding as a reward). If not, prove the non-existence of such a polyhedron (and book your flight out of the country, to somewhere far enough away to be out of the reach of his power).</p>

<p><sub>(Note: this puzzle sounds much better if you read all the Godfather's words in Marlon Brando's voice.)</sub></p>

<p><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/2497/whats-the-password">War has broken out in the kingdom.</a> The king's castle is guarded pretty heavily, by guards with instructions to kill anyone who can't produce the correct password.</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to the guards, the beggars near the main gate are in fact enemy spies. They listen intently as the first knight approaches. "Six!", the guard calls out. "Three," answers the knight. He is allowed through. "Aha," the spies think.</p>

<p>But they needs to be sure. They see another knight approaching and listen in on his exchange with the guard. "Twelve!", "Six!"</p>

<p>One spy decides he's heard enough, so he leaves and returns dressed as a knight. "Eighteen!" The spy answers "nine" and is killed on the spot by the guards.</p>

<p>Another spy, who used to browse Puzzling.SE before he signed up for the Espionage Division feels a moment of deja vu, and decides he now knows the answer. As night falls, he goes off and disguises himself as a knight. He comes back in the morning and walks up to the guard.</p>

<p>"Eighteen!" shouts the guard, "Eight!" the spy replies. The guard cuts him down, and he makes a surprised "gurgle...splot" noise as he dies.</p>

<p>The last spy, still in hiding is confused. As he's thinking, another knights walks up. "Twelve!" is the challenge, "Zero!" comes the reply. The guard steps aside and the knight enters.</p>

<p>Finally, the last spy gets up, goes off and does the whole dress-as-a-knight thing and comes back. "Eighteen!" shouts the guard. What is the correct response?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The answer to TWELVE could have been Zero or Six either time - both were correct. This is one of only two such cases of 2 valid answers.</p>

<p><strong>Edit for anyone who sees this in the future:</strong> I'm aware that it's not fully-scoped. It's my first puzzle and I neglected to give any odd-number examples, which is kind of important. It's totally solvable without them, I just should have included at least one.</p>

<p>Below is an initial state for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Conway's Game of Life</a> with a single pulsar. Living cells are white.</p>

<p>The area marked with red is your base. You are free to modify any of the red cells, but only those, and only in the initial generation. You are not allowed to do anything once the simulation starts.</p>

<p>Your goal is to <strong>move</strong> the pulsar so that its center is within area of the base – in other words, the game must reach a generation where only a pulsar with its center in the red area remains/loops infinitely and everything else is destroyed. Yet in other, way cooler words: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have to construct a rocket to <strong>move</strong> the Sun and nothing else that was created in the process to remain.</p>

<p>The grid is infinite in every direction, i. e. runaway gliders still count as living.</p>

<h2><a name="question14758"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/14758">Wanted: Family of 6</a></h2>

<p>After many years, authorities are still looking for a family of 6, five of whom are suspected of many multiple-country border crossings with no passports or proper identification. Although no known damage has been done, the homeland security divisions of many countries are irate, and continue "to spend much time and money until these 6 are found and punished."</p>

<p>A recent tip led investigators to believe that 5 of the 6 are still actively on the run, and that these 5 meet with the 6th member (believed to be the leader) at the same time each day, presumably to plan future evasion tactics. However, no sightings of any of the 6 have been documented, leaving authorities puzzled.</p>

<p>On multiple occasions, top intelligence in many different countries led several police forces to some of the family members' projected locations, but each time officers have reported an eerie feeling of 1 or more members of the family being extremely close to them, yet none were seen.</p>

<p><strong>The official, but limited, suspect information:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Priscilla, mother and leader, at least 8 counts of trespassing, claims her children are not doing any harm, and that she has trained them on the straight and narrow path their whole lives</li>
  <li>Ed, tallest sibling, 13 counts of trespassing, the most famous of the 5 siblings worldwide</li>
  <li>Caitlin, 17 counts of trespassing</li>
  <li>Cadence, twin sister of Caitlin, at least 12 counts of trespassing</li>
  <li>Arnold, 8 counts of trespassing</li>
  <li>Anthony, twin brother of Arnold, multiple counts of aiding and abetting</li>
  </ol>

<p>You're sitting at your Alphabet City Police Department sergeant's desk on a normal Wednesday when the phone rings.</p>

<p>"Oh my god, oh my god!  Please help me.  It's my pet word. It's been, well, I don't know exactly, but...oh, the <em>horror!</em>" says a frightened voice.</p>

<p>"Calm down, sir.  Please tell me what happened."</p>

<p>"I didn't see it.  But others did.  Just come down to the intersection of Character and Grapheme.  SOON. Please!  The poor little thing.  Only <strong>four letters long</strong> and then this happens..."</p>

<p>You hang up the phone and glance at the pile of DUIs and B&amp;Es looming on your desk, and can't keep a sigh from escaping.  You didn't get into Letter Policing for this, sitting at a desk day after day, going through the motions...  Even if this story turns out to be gibberish, at least it's something unusual.  You grab your coat.</p>

<p>"I'm heading downtown."</p>

<hr>

<p>Your ABCPD squad car pulls up at the intersection of Character and Grapheme, and you step out.  Several cars are already on the scene, and the crowd is clearly disturbed; you spot one man kneeling near a wall, fighting with each breath not to be sick again.</p>

<p>A junior officer runs up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Sarge, thank goodness you're here.  I've been taking eyewitness accounts.  Apparently this guy tied up his pet word while he was shopping for vowels.  Then a gang showed up, four words in all, and started harassing the pet word."  </p>
  
  <p>"You sure it was a gang?" you ask.  </p>
  
  <p>"Yes, sir.  Witnesses all agree the four words were related.  But then someone called the cops and the gang panicked.  Apparently, to stop themselves from being recognized, the gang viciously ripped apart the pet word, then each gang member <strong>took one of the letters from the pet word, added it to himself, and rearranged his letters to make a new word</strong>."  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You understand why the man was fighting to keep his lunch down.  You swallow hard, and focus on the facts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"What then?"  </p>
  
  <p>"Well, each of the disguised gang members fled in a different direction.  We got here ASAP though, so each one only made it a block before we showed up."</p>
  
  <p>"Okay, so they're still in the area."  </p>
  
  <p>"Yes, sir. But...well, it seems that they've further disguised themselves."  </p>
  
  <p>"Dammit!  How!?"  </p>
  
  <p>"Well, the one who fled north came to a law-abiding group of words having a meeting.  He heard sirens, and knew he didn't have time to flee anymore.  He also knew that he'd be caught if he tried to blend in with the group, since they were all similar to one another and he wasn't.  So instead..."</p>
  
  <p>"Spit it out, officer."  </p>
  
  <p>"It seems, sir, that <strong>he split himself up into letters, and added one letter to each of the words in the group.  He then forced them to rearrange themselves to disguise their relationship</strong> so he could blend in."  </p>
  
  <p>"Diabolical.  What about the other three?"  </p>
  
  <p>"Same thing, sir, but they just ran in different directions, and found different groups to hide in."  </p>
  
  <p>"So where are these poor innocents who have been dragged into this mess now?"  </p>
  
  <p>"We've got them all detained, sir.  Waiting for you to inspect them."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's for days like this that you always carry TUMS.  You tilt your head back and drop in enough to quell your body's natural reaction to this senseless butchering.  The four groups of words await your interrogation.  You stop and think about the facts.  Focus on the facts, not that poor little 4-letter pet...</p>

<p>If—you reason—you go to each group of words, you should be able to <strong>remove a letter from each, then rearrange the remaining letters into words that are related...those will yield the law-abiding groups who were unwittingly brought into this mess.  The letters you remove from each group will form the disguised gang members.  If you can then remove a letter from each of those disguised gang members, and rearrange the leftovers, you'll reveal the identity of the gang and its members...and more importantly you can stitch the removed letters back together</strong>, and give this guy his pet word back.</p>

<p>Well, you may not be the greatest letter detective in history, but today you're damn well going to make a difference.</p>

<h2><a name="question55600"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/55600">Can you open the bathroom door?</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">53 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/40607">sousben#40607</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/9422">Lawrence#9422</a></p>

<p>This happened to me in a rental apartment and I had to be creative to solve it.</p>

<p>The <strong>geniuses</strong> who designed the bathroom managed to fit a drawer about a centimeter behind the door, and eventually what had to go wrong went wrong: the drawer was full of stuff and once we closed the door, the drawer reopened a bit,  blocking the door from opening more than about a centimeter, blocking us from entering the bathroom.</p>

<p><strong>Position 1</strong><br>
The setup when the door is closed and the drawer is closed normally (view from above)</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bvmUp.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/bvmUp.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p><strong>Position 2</strong><br>
This is what happened when the drawer blocked the door:
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k14TG.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/k14TG.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>This only left about a centimeter of leeway for opening the door from outside  </p>

<p>Not enough to let daylight go through, but enough for me to be able to get the drawer to open even more by pushing the door back and forth.
And because of the form factor of the drawer (the front panel being a couple of centimeters larger than the drawer itself, I felt the more the drawer would open, the more I could open the door, to the point that I could actually get a finger in.</p>

<p><strong>Position 3</strong><br>
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zzAx7.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/zzAx7.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Using a metal hanger, I could manage to open the drawer even more, or close it a bit, but closing it would make the front panel of the drawer apply pressure to the door, eventually bringing me back to Position 2, where I couldn't fit anything in anymore to close the drawer further.  </p>

<p>I spoke to the locksmith who said he could make a hole in the door in order to close the drawer. This would mean I'd have to replace the door afterwards, for a price of about 100$.</p>

<p>I decided to first test my puzzle solving skills and figure out a <strong>significantly cheaper</strong> way of closing it.  </p>

<p>Other elements that may or may not be useful:<br>
- the door handle was situated above the drawer, too high to touch it or anything<br>
- the bottom of the door was about half a centimeter above the floor, letting daylight go through<br>
- lifting the door up its hinge was not an option because unless fully opened, the frame would block it<br>
- I lived in a city with all kinds of shops where I could buy all kinds of tools or accessories<br>
- I lived on a third floor, and there were bars to the window of the bathroom, meaning no human would be able to get in, even with a high enough ladder, and the window was closed anyway  </p>

<p><strong>Could you find a way to open the door without breaking anything?</strong></p>

<p><em>EDITS</em><br>
- I only drew one side of the door frame, but it was the same step-shape on both sides as well as on top, preventing access to the hinge for example<br>
- the drawers don't have handles. I only put them on the picture for illustration, so that people understand they are drawers :-)<br>
- taking the drawer out of its rails is not an option, because it needs to lift it with both hands, also, falling on the floor would most likely break it, which I wanted to avoid  </p>

I'm excited to see if somebody knows the riddle or if not, how you approach the solution.</em></p>

<p>Three mathematicians are in prison. Each of them is in a single cell and they are not able to communicate in any way. They are imprisoned for an arbitrary number of days.</p>

<p>Each cell has a single light bulb that is either on or off on a given day. The warden tells the mathematicians that the light system of the prison has three modes: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>neutral</strong> mode, where each lightbulb is independent of the others</li>
<li><strong>bright</strong> mode, where two bulbs turn <em>on</em> every day and the other turns <em>off</em></li>
<li><strong>dark</strong> mode, where two bulbs turn <em>off</em> every day and the other turns <em>on</em></li>
</ul>

<p>(All distributions are not necessarily uniform.)</p>

<p>The prison starts in <strong>neutral</strong> mode. After an unknown but finite number of days, the warden will select either <strong>bright</strong> mode or <strong>dark</strong> mode, which is locked in permanently.</p>

<p>After countably infinitely many days have passed, the mathematicians are asked which one the warden picked. They may discuss strategy before going into the cells, but there will be no communication afterwards. They have unlimited capacities to communicate and remember strategies that they come up with. Two of the three need to guess correctly to escape; how can they ensure this? <em>You may assume that the axiom of choice holds.</em></p>

<h2><a name="question15097"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/15097">Who shall come to the tea party?</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">52 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/9286">Trevor Powell#9286</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/12109">mmking#12109</a></p>

<p>All of your stuffed animals are assembled, anxiously waiting to learn who will be be invited as the Guest of Honor to your next tea party.  </p>

<p>This is to be an exclusive party, after all, as there is to be only <em>one</em> Guest of Honor.  This is by necessity, because you have only two strawberry pastries, and you obviously intend to eat one of those yourself. (Cook was most annoyed with you for taking so many infinite bags of pastries yesterday, and has since cut off your supply).  All the other guests at the tea party shall only receive tea.</p>

<p>So now you must decide which of your many guests will be the Guest of Honor, who receives the coveted strawberry pastry.</p>

<p>Your first instinct, of course, is to invite the valiant Mr. Bun to be the Guest of Honor.  After all, he's brave and noble and always tells the truth.  But then you think of poor insidious Duke Froggington II, who admittedly is dastardly and always lies, but in your heart you know that these character flaws are only due to his tragic childhood.  You see, the perfidious Duke Froggington II grew up all alone in a dank 30-meter well, trying to leap his way to light and freedom.  You know what that's like, and your heart aches for him.  And there are similar reasons why you might choose almost any of the six dozen other stuffed animals that pack every available surface in your bedroom.</p>

<p>No, you find that you're completely unable to decide which stuffed animal should be the Guest of Honor at your tea party, and so you instead devise a game for the stuffed animals to play, to determine the Guest of Honor fairly.</p>

<p>The game works in this way:</p>

<p>First, you choose Mr. Bun as the initial nominee as Guest of Honor.  He's the obvious first candidate, as the noblest of all your stuffed animals.</p>

<p>Then, starting with the nefarious Duke Froggington II and descending through the other stuffed animals in order of seniority and ending with Peanut (an ugly mouse given to you by your annoying older sister at your last birthday fête, and usually tucked far back in your dresser behind your latin coursebooks), each stuffed animal still in attendance is asked if they wish to declare themselves to be the new nominee as Guest of Honor.  If they do, then they become the new nominee, and the previous nominee is returned to the toy chest, where they must remain until after the tea party.</p>

<p>Whenever the nominee changes, the whole process starts again;  Every animal (in order of seniority, and starting with the most senior remaining animal) is given a fresh opportunity to nominate themselves, even if they had previously chosen not to.  As before, if an animal chooses to nominate themselves, the current nominee is returned to the toy chest, and may not attend the tea party.</p>

<p>This process continues until no further stuffed animals wish to declare themselves as the nominee.</p>

<p>Once no more stuffed animals wish to make themselves the nominee, whoever remains as the nominee shall become the Guest of Honor and will receive a strawberry pastry at the tea party.  The other remaining stuffed animals shall receive tea.  Any stuffed animals in the toy chest get nothing. (At least, not until they're brought out again for the next tea party (which will likely be in ten minutes or so))</p>

<p>A few obvious points which you know instinctively are:</p>

<ul>
<li>All stuffed animals <em>love</em> strawberry pastries (as does everyone of refinement and distinction.  Peanut would probably love strawberry pastries too, despite having neither refinement nor distinction, though you've certainly never wasted one on her, even yesterday when you had several infinite supplies of them).  This means that each stuffed animal dearly wishes to be the Guest of Honor.</li>
<li>All stuffed animals like tea, so none of them wish to completely miss the party by being put back into the toy chest.</li>
<li>All stuffed animals are perfect logicians (I mean, obviously.  Do I even need to mention this?)</li>
<li>Stuffed animals don't hold grudges against one another;  they will remain fast friends even if one sends another to the toy chest.  On the contrary, they will recognise that it was the only logical thing to do, and will probably laugh about it at your next tea party, later this afternoon.</li>
<li>While the treacherous Duke Froggington II always lies, you've long since adapted to that, and aren't ever confused any more about what he means when he tells you which door leads to certain doom and which leads to your afternoon Latin classes (though you're still not convinced that there's actually much of a difference between the two).  Similarly, there will be no confusion on your part about whether or not he wishes to become the new nominee, regardless of what lies he might say.</li>
<li>For the sake of clarity, you have six dozen and two stuffed animals in total.  With Mr. Bun as your favourite, the despicable Duke Froggington II as your second favourite, and Peanut as your least favourite.  Other stuffed animals may be identified by number, with the next animal after the treacherous Duke Froggington II being number 3.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Of your stuffed animals, how many will attend your tea party, and which will be the Guest of Honor?</strong></p>

<h2><a name="question23150"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/23150">How to beat Count Dracula</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">52 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/8874">Gamow#8874</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/16608">The Dark Truth#16608</a></p>

<p>Abraham Van Helsing and Jonathan Harker play a game against Count Dracula.
The three players agree on the following rules:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Count Dracula and Van Helsing enter the crypt, while Jonathan Harker has to wait outside. The crypt contains 1000 coffins that are numbered from 1 up to 1000, together with 1000 golden lockets that are engraved with the numbers from 1 to 1000.
  Each of the numbers from 1 to 1000 occurs on exactly one coffin and on exactly one locket.</p></li>
  <li><p>Count Dracula puts the lockets into the coffins, so that every coffin contains exactly one locket. Van Helsing observes this, and knows exactly which locket is in which coffin.</p></li>
  <li><p>Now it is Van Helsing's turn:  Van Helsing may (but does not have to) pick a pair of coffins and switch the lockets in these two coffins. Dracula observes the action of Van Helsing.</p></li>
  <li><p>Van Helsing now leaves the crypt through the back door. Jonathan Harker (who has gained no additional knowledge over the choices of Dracula and Van Helsing in the first three steps) enters the crypt.</p></li>
  <li><p>Count Dracula chooses an integer $N$ with $1\le N\le1000$, and announces $N$ to Jonathan.</p></li>
  <li><p>Jonathan is allowed to perform 500 search steps of the following form: Jonathan chooses a coffin, opens it, and checks whether the locket in this coffin carries the number $N$.</p></li>
  <li><ul>
  <li>If Jonathan Harker finds the locket with number $N$ during his 500 search steps, then he and Van Helsing have won the game. In this case, they are allowed to drive a wooden stake through Dracula's heart.  </li>
  <li>If Harker does not manage to find the locket with number $N$, then Count Dracula is allowed to drink Van Helsing's and Harker's blood to the last remaining drop.</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Harker and Van Helsing discuss their options and want to agree on a good strategy.
If Harker chooses his 500 coffins simply at random, then the team Harker &amp; Van Helsing has a 50% probability of winning the game.  Is there a strategy that would guarantee them an even better probability of success?</p>
