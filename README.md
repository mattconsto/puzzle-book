# puzzle-book

After recent browsing, I had the idea to convert the [Puzzling Stack Exchange](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com) into a book. Overall, the project was a success, however maths is currently not rendered as such. The book contains the top 100 questions and answers ever submitted to the site, formatted nicely to fit into a small A5 book(let).

I would like to thank the [Puzzling Stack Exchange](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com) community for writing the puzzles, [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com) for providing the data, and [creativecommons.org](https://creativecommons.org) for making this possible. Like the puzzles within, the book is licensed under the CC BY-SA 3.0 license. The book was created using the [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com) to gather data, Python to parse and structure the data, and Pandoc to typeset as PDF.

And thank you, the reader for reading this "book". I hope you enjoy the puzzles. If you wish to contribute to this book, it can be found on [my github](https://github.com/mattconsto/puzzle-book).
