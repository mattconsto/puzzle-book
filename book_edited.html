<h2><a name="question28494"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/28494">This is important. I need you to listen…</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">292 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5208">Alconja#5208</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/11876">Deusovi#11876</a></p>

<p>Look, you don't know me. We've never met. But, like I said, I need you to listen...</p>

<p>I had the most disturbing dream the other night... Woke up in a cold sweat and couldn't get back to sleep. It wasn't a nightmare as such, just ... eerie, I guess? I don't even remember the details, but it left me with a real sense of foreboding. Weird thing about dreams, so clear when you have them, but the details fade so quickly... Vivid, yet fuzzy... And the strange logic that applies... Inconsistent flow of time... Disjointed cause and effect...</p>

<p>I'm rambling... The thing is, when I woke up, I found an odd magazine clipping on my bedside table. It feels so familiar, like I've had it for quite a while, but for some reason, I can't remember how or when I acquired it. Wherever it came from, all I know is that it I gives me the same creepy feeling my dream did.</p>

<p>Anyway, the strangest part about all this is... And perhaps you won't believe me... But, this piece of paper, I think...</p>

<p>...I think it's meant for <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>The magnets are tetrominoes. There are 7 of each shape. Is it possible to arrange them into a 7x28 rectangle so that they are all used and all inside the rectangle?</p>

<p><strong>Hints:</strong></p>

  <p> You don't need any hints, they are littered throughout the images everywhere, and I'm not giving you any more. :)<br>

 Ok, I will perhaps assist in framing things a little... This is actually a deceptively simple puzzle (though, simple $\ne$ easy). It isn't multiple layers deep, even if it may appear that way. In fact, there's really only a single puzzle to be solved here, and I believe it's actually doable with information from only three of the images. Most of the rest are hints and pointers to make your life easier, but also to distract a little. Part of the challenge is in filtering the truly necessary information from the noise, and in taking the lessons learned from the hints and applying them to the actual puzzle.<br>
<br>
 I'll just add one last bit of extra information (which you shouldn't take as a hint, so much as a clarification, for when you get a certain distance in): The security panel's circuitry contains a paradox prevention system...</p>

<p>I was walking home late last night and heard raised voices coming from a boarded up old warehouse. I stopped, out of sight, to listen...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>[When I started eavesdropping, the conversation was already under way...]</em> </p>
  
  <p><strong>Gangster 1</strong>: -infiltrator in our midst, and I know who it is... <em>[dramatic pause]</em> ...It's you isn't it!<br>
  <strong>Gangster 2</strong>: Me?<br>
  <strong>G1</strong>: What? No... him.<br>
  <strong>Gangster 3</strong>: That's ridiculous! I'm no traitor! How do we know it's not you?!<br>
  <strong>G2</strong>: It's not me!<br>
  <strong>G3</strong>: No... him... <em>[under breath]</em> ...idiot.<br>
  <strong>G1</strong>: That doesn't even make sense. I'm the most prolific amongst us. When would I even have the chance to work for the opposition?<br>
  <strong>G3</strong>: What do you mean? I'm in every day!<br>
  <strong>Gangster 4</strong>: <em>[to himself]</em> Me too, but you don't hear me harping on...<br>
  <strong>G3</strong>: <em>[continuing]</em> Not to mention I saw you with your ex last week on my way out of here... And I won't mention who I saw him hanging out with <em>again</em> yesterday...<br>
  <strong>G2</strong>: We weren't hanging out! I was just stuck behind him in a queue!<br>
  <strong>Gangster 5</strong>: Hey, we all fraternize with the enemy now and then... It's necessary to meet our goals... But this is different. From what I hear, half the time you act like you <em>are</em> one of them!  </p>
  
  <p><em>[A street sweeper drove slowly by, so I missed a little of the conversation...]</em>  </p>
  
  <p><strong>G3</strong>: It's a set up! Think about it... Who would gain the most from seeing me dead? ...I would!<br>
  <strong>Gangster 6</strong>: 'strue, but 'e would too...<br>
  <strong>G1</strong>: Sure, he occasionally fills in for me, but he could practically replace you!<br>
  <strong>G2</strong>: No he couldn't!<br>
  <strong>G6/G1/G3</strong>: Would you shut up!<br>
  <strong>G4</strong>: Geez settle down guys, what's with all the yelling?<br>
  <strong>G1</strong>: Because no one was talking to you!<br>
  <strong>G4</strong>: Ahh... Gotcha...  </p>
  
  <p><em>[A crowd of drunken revellers stumbled by and as I slipped into an alley to remain unseen, I missed another few minutes of the argument...]</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>G1</strong>: Gimme one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now!<br>
  <strong>G2</strong>: I didn't do anything wrong!<br>
  <strong>G3</strong>: Wait... Who are we talking about now?<br>
  <strong>G1</strong>: You!<br>
  <strong>G2</strong>: Oh...<br>
  <strong>G5</strong>: Why?<br>
  <strong>G1</strong>: Yes!  </p>
  
  <p><em>[From here things escalated rapidly, and when gunshots were fired, I made a run for it...]</em>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I went to the police but when they visited the scene, the gang was gone, and everything had already been cleaned. They said there wasn't enough to go on unless I could identify the victim and the perpetrators.</p>

<p><strong>Who was the gang?</strong><br>
<strong>Which member was killed?</strong><br>
<strong>Why were they killed?</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: What was the name of each gangster?</p>

<h2><a name="question31247"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/31247">Game of Life: Kill the Sun</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">152 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/20572">BaSzAt#20572</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/15856">kamenf#15856</a></p>

<p>Below is an initial state for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" rel="noreferrer">Conway's Game of Life</a> with a single pulsar. Living cells are white.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iid1g.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/Iid1g.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>The area marked with red is your base. You are free to modify any of the red cells, but only those, and only in the initial generation. You are not allowed to do anything once the simulation starts.</p>

<p>Your goal is to annihilate every living cell in the grid – in other words, the game must reach a generation where every cell is dead, even in your base. Yet in other, way cooler words: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have to construct a rocket to destroy the Sun and everything that was created in the process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The grid is infinite in every direction, i. e. runaway gliders still count as living.</p>

<p>You may use a brute force algorithm if you really wish, but I don't recommend you to. For one thing, you're up against the halting problem. Besides, finding a good construction all by yourself is fun (at least it was for me).</p>

<p>What I do recommend is downloading a good GoL simulator – solving this with only a paper and a pencil is probably not so much fun.</p>

<p class="subtitle">134 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/185">dwjohnston#185</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/310">njzk2#310</a></p>

<h3>The riddle</h3>

<p>Randall Munroe (of <a href="https://xkcd.com">xkcd</a> fame) has, a bit hidden on his site, <a href="https://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html">a logic puzzle</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A group of people with assorted eye colors live on an island. They are
  all perfect logicians -- if a conclusion can be logically deduced,
  they will do it instantly. No one knows the color of their eyes. Every
  night at midnight, a ferry stops at the island. Any islanders who have
  figured out the color of their own eyes then leave the island, and the
  rest stay. Everyone can see everyone else at all times and keeps a
  count of the number of people they see with each eye color (excluding
  themselves), but they cannot otherwise communicate. Everyone on the
  island knows all the rules in this paragraph.</p>
  
  <p>On this island there are 100 blue-eyed people, 100 brown-eyed people,
  and the Guru (she happens to have green eyes). So any given blue-eyed
  person can see 100 people with brown eyes and 99 people with blue eyes
  (and one with green), but that does not tell him his own eye color; as
  far as he knows the totals could be 101 brown and 99 blue. Or 100
  brown, 99 blue, and he could have red eyes.</p>
  
  <p>The Guru is allowed to speak once (let's say at noon), on one day in
  all their endless years on the island. Standing before the islanders,
  she says the following:</p>
  
  <p>"I can see someone who has blue eyes."</p>
  
  <p>Who leaves the island, and on what night?</p>
  
  <p>There are no mirrors or reflecting surfaces, nothing dumb. It is not a
  trick question, and the answer is logical. It doesn't depend on tricky
  wording or anyone lying or guessing, and it doesn't involve people
  doing something silly like creating a sign language or doing genetics.
  The Guru is not making eye contact with anyone in particular; she's
  simply saying "I count at least one blue-eyed person on this island
  who isn't me."</p>
  
  <p>And lastly, the answer is not "no one leaves."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He admits the puzzle isn't his:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I didn't come up with the idea of this puzzle, but I've written and rewritten it over the the years to try to make a definitive version. The guy who told it to me originally was some dude on the street in Boston named Joel.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>The answer</h3>

<p>He gives <a href="https://xkcd.com/solution.html">his solution</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The answer is that on the 100th day, all 100 blue-eyed people will leave. It's pretty convoluted logic and it took me a while to believe the solution, but here's a rough guide to how to get there. Note -- while the text of the puzzle is very carefully worded to be as clear and unambiguous as possible (thanks to countless discussions with confused readers), this solution is pretty thrown-together. It's correct, but the explanation/wording might not be the best. If you're really confused by something, let me know.</p>
  
  <p>If you consider the case of just one blue-eyed person on the island, you can show that he obviously leaves the first night, because he knows he's the only one the Guru could be talking about. He looks around and sees no one else, and knows he should leave. So: [THEOREM 1] If there is one blue-eyed person, he leaves the first night.</p>
  
  <p>If there are two blue-eyed people, they will each look at the other. They will each realize that "if I don't have blue eyes [HYPOTHESIS 1], then that guy is the only blue-eyed person. And if he's the only person, by THEOREM 1 he will leave tonight." They each wait and see, and when neither of them leave the first night, each realizes "My HYPOTHESIS 1 was incorrect. I must have blue eyes." And each leaves the second night.</p>
  
  <p>So: [THEOREM 2]: If there are two blue-eyed people on the island, they will each leave the 2nd night.</p>
  
  <p>If there are three blue-eyed people, each one will look at the other two and go through a process similar to the one above. Each considers the two possibilities -- "I have blue eyes" or "I don't have blue eyes." He will know that if he doesn't have blue eyes, there are only two blue-eyed people on the island -- the two he sees. So he can wait two nights, and if no one leaves, he knows he must have blue eyes -- THEOREM 2 says that if he didn't, the other guys would have left. When he sees that they didn't, he knows his eyes are blue. All three of them are doing this same process, so they all figure it out on day 3 and leave.</p>
  
  <p>This induction can continue all the way up to THEOREM 99, which each person on the island in the problem will of course know immediately. Then they'll each wait 99 days, see that the rest of the group hasn't gone anywhere, and on the 100th night, they all leave.</p>
  
  <p>Before you email me to argue or question: This solution is correct. My explanation may not be the clearest, and it's very difficult to wrap your head around (at least, it was for me), but the facts of it are accurate. I've talked the problem over with many logic/math professors, worked through it with students, and analyzed from a number of different angles. The answer is correct and proven, even if my explanations aren't as clear as they could be.</p>
  
  <p>User lolbifrons on reddit posted <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/khhpl/reddit_what_is_your_favorite_riddle/c2kdlr6">an inductive proof</a>.</p>
  
  <p>If you're satisfied with this answer, here are a couple questions that may force you to further explore the structure of the puzzle: </p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>What is the quantified piece of information that the Guru provides that each person did not already have? </li>
  <li>Each person knows, from the beginning, that there are no less than 99 blue-eyed people on the island. How, then, is considering the 1 and 2-person cases relevant, if they can all rule them out immediately as possibilities? </li>
  <li>Why do they have to wait 99 nights if, on the first 98 or so of these nights, they're simply verifying something that they already know? </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>These are just to give you something to think about if you enjoyed the main solution. They have answers, but please don't email me asking for them. They're meant to prompt thought on the solution, and each can be answered by considering the solution from the right angle, in the right terms. There's a different way to think of the solution involving hypotheticals inside hypotheticals, and it is much more concrete, if a little harder to discuss. But in it lies the key to answering the four questions above.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>The question</h3>

<p>Everybody on the island could have come to the conclusion that 'There is at least one person with blue eyes', simply by looking around, seeing 100 people with blue eyes, and realising that everybody can see at least one person with blue eyes.</p>

<p><strong>So why is it necessary for the Guru to say 'I see at least one person with blue eyes' to get the ball rolling?</strong></p>

<p>Two adventurers, Merlin and Hermes, approached a large iron door built into a cliff face."Well...", said Hermes, "What do we do now?". Merlin produced an old, large piece of crumpled paper from his pocket. "Hrm...", Merlin mumbled. "It says here that we must speak the six letter keyword to open the door and enter the secret chamber, but I don't remember seeing any signs as to what that keyword might be..."</p>

<p>After a bit of searching, Hermes notices something etched into the ground. "Come over here!", he yelled, pointing frantically. And sure enough, barely visible and obscured by dust, was a series of lines of differing color etched into the ground:</p>

<p><img src="images/BXWwr.png" alt="You&#39;re looking at it the wrong way!"></p>

<p>"Ah", Merlin said, "So that is the keyword." Hermes was lost and confused. After staring at it for another thirty seconds, he grumbled "What keyword!? All I see is a bunch of lines!". Merlin simply responded, "You're just <em>looking at it the wrong way</em>. It's obvious!"</p>

<p><strong><em>Isn't it?</em></strong></p>

<h2><a name="question3215"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/3215">A double-agent with a conundrum</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">118 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/4160">John Meacham#4160</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/2819">martin#2819</a></p>

<p>You are a double-agent in the most important war of the 20th century, The
Falklands war. For years you have been playing the United Kingdom and Argentinian
governments against each other, taking bribes from both sides and it has caught
up with you.</p>

<p>One day travelling you are snatched off the street, kidnapped, drugged and
placed on a private plane. You wake up in a cell, you know you have been taken by
one of the governments to their capital for interrogation and treason charges but
you cannot tell which has abducted you. You have perfected both the UK and
Argentinian languages and accents and you know you can convince the guards to
let you go if you were to speak in their native tongue asking for your
government contact. However speaking the wrong language first will
certainly turn out very poorly for you indeed.</p>

<p>You look around your cell, it is a large room with high ceilings, a musty smell,
and thick dust covering everything. Based on being unable to hear anything and
the constant temperature you conclude you are underground. Nothing about the architecture is distinctive. The only things in
the cell are a single metal chair bolted to the floor in the center of the room
with a spotlight hanging from a cord right above the chair illuminating the
seat brightly leaving the rest of the room in shadow. You know it is a matter of time
before you are tied into the chair and interrogated by shadowy agents of one of
the governments. </p>

<p>You search desperately for a clue as to where you are. You
kick the chair and stub your toe; it is solid. You claw at the light, looking for a marking
or a way to open it and see the voltage rating but cannot find either. You yank
and pull on it to test how secure it is and cannot dislodge it from the ceiling
to get at the cord. You try to swing it far enough to smash against a wall but it will not reach. You search the chair for a makers mark but can find none.
You know much more action will invite suspicion even if you know the right
language so you stand back and think.</p>

<p>The guard watching on CCTV notices, but decides it is normal behaviour for
someone waking up in a cell regardless of guilt so is not immediately
suspicious. As far as he can tell you then pace around the room randomly for a
few hours deep in thought.</p>

<p>You suddenly walk towards the door and knock, with 100% confidence you
correctly ask in perfect Spanish for your government handler who promptly
releases you.</p>

<p>How did you know what government to ask for?</p>

<ul>
<li><em>You can assume you are correct in all your assumptions mentioned in the puzzle.</em></li>
<li><em>You have no items other than the clothes and shoes you were wearing when abducted. no cell phone, no watch, no pocket lint etc.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="question33523"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/33523">The Rube Wordberg Machine</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">113 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5208">Alconja#5208</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/21234">Dan Russell#21234</a></p>

<p>Gah! <em>I</em> used to be the brilliant one at Verba Retorta University, but ever since that damned Professor Wordberg showed up, there's been nothing but trouble. And it's all his confounded machine's fault!</p>

<p>He's a fraud &ndash; he has to be &ndash; I just needed enough evidence to prove it. So, last night, I... Look, it's not important how I got in there, but purely by happenstance, I found myself in Wordberg's lab after everyone else had left (and, as a tenured professor, I can assure you, I have every right to be there). Anyway, with no one else around, I took the opportunity to gather the proof I needed. I grabbed four words I happened to have in my pocket, loaded them up and started up his alleged "word transformation engine"...</p>

<p>Here's the video footage I took of the process (sorry for the poor quality, my phone's a little dated):</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uIJrT.gif"><img src="images/uIJrT.png" alt="The Rube Wordberg Machine"></a></p>
<p>The words I put into the machine were <strong>smallscale</strong>, <strong>nosier</strong>, <strong>apron</strong>, and <strong>outputs</strong>.</p>

<p>Anyway, after a lot of show, the machine's output was unceremoniously dropped into the bin at the bottom. But this is where things went wrong, and where I'm hoping you can help... The most obvious problem is that the machine <em>appears to have actually worked(!)</em>, but right now that's not my concern. The immediate issue is that there were already words in the bin at the bottom and I don't know which are mine and which were already there. To make matters worse, some of them have been broken in the fall, and again, I don't know if they're mine:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2dgBO.png"><img src="images/2dgBO.png" alt="bin of words"></a></p>
<p>The words in the bin appear to be <strong>jerseys</strong>, <strong>tangible</strong>, <strong>pulse</strong>, <strong>newsletter</strong>, <strong>inputs</strong>, <strong>antonym</strong>, <strong>unpins</strong>, <strong>mustard</strong>, <strong>afford</strong>, and <strong>factory</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, <em>under no circumstances</em> can Professor Wordberg know I was in here, so in order to hide the evidence, I need you to help me work out:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Which words from the bin are the, now transformed, words that I loaded in?</strong></li>
<li><strong>If either of the two broken words are <em>not</em> mine, what word can I put through the machine again to create an unbroken copy?</strong></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>To xxxxx,<br><br>
  /<br><br>
  Curiosity killed the cat, so whatever you do, please don’t come and find me. You need to save your energy for the kids. Please just trust me, this is for the best. <br><br>
  Obviously, I think I’ll come back. But please be patient. I wouldn’t leave my family unless I had to. I’ll stay <em>hidden</em> until it’s safe to return. I’ve left no clues, that would be too dangerous.<br><br>
  Unexpectedly someone has come after me. I had to completely disappear very quickly indeed. I had time to write this <em>message</em> or try and call you. My phone was dead, you were out so I wrote this. Wow, I won’t forget that feeling of panic. Hopefully you can see I had no choice about leaving. It wasn’t me that chose to leave, I was forced. <br><br>
  Now again, I must tell you not to come and find me. <em>In</em> the case that you do, then the chances are you won’t find me. There’s zero clues which lead to me.  <br><br>
  Tell all the kids to be brave. I think that they’ll struggle and find it hard without a mother. And it’ll be my fault. I wish I could tell you my location so I could see you again.<br><br>
  Note I don’t want anyone knowing about this. Anyone that you call who asks, tell them I ran away, not the truth. And whatever you do don’t tell the police. <br><br>
  I would have stayed but I couldn’t have or I’d have been caught. The <em>first</em> thing that I did was to call a taxi. Then I think we must have hit a car, I'm sure I’ll sue the driver if I get a chance.<br><br>
  Never before had I been angrier. I couldn’t even get out of the car, and the state the back of it was in was unbelievable. I miss home so badly. If I could see it again, I really would do anything.<br><br>
   Even now, so far away, I love you and I’ll try and send <em>letters</em>. It’s you that I want to see again. I will come back as soon as possible. Try and find hope and some faith in that.<br><br>
  Love from me, <br><br>

<p>Between your house and her house, you have to cross 7 bridges, and as it goes in the land of make believe, there is a troll under every bridge!

<p>How many cakes do you have to leave home with to make sure that you arrive at Grandma's with exactly 2 cakes?</p>

  <p>Hearken, now, and listen close; I have so much to tell.<br>
  Now lend an ear and do your job; you surely will excel.<br>
  To find my hidden message, gaze on every word herein.<br>
  While skimming through it might be fast, you'll miss the quiet gem.</p>
  
  <p>How vitally important are the details of this verse;<br>
  examining them closely is the task to take on first.<br>
  And once they've been digested, one may feel the need to snooze;<br>
  now please reject that feeling and keep minding p's and q's.</p>
  
  <p>Time and time again, you need to squelch the urge to rush.<br>
  I know that if you get too lax, you'll miss some clues and such.<br>
  So look at each word carefully; just read them one-by-one.<br>
  My friend, if every word's perused, your work is almost done!</p>
  
  <p>I know that all this vigilance may start to vex or chafe.<br>
  So here's a hint to help you out and keep you feeling safe:<br>
  Some people say that punctuation rules are absolute.<br>
  Ill-use of them is abject and quite low, there's no dispute.</p>
  
  <p>Now, as you keep perusing, you may find a common theme.<br>
  Getting down and dirty is the answer, it may seem.<br>
  Find every hidden message in the fine points of the text.<br>
  Rush to do your job, and quiz specific aspects next.  </p>
  
  <p>Oh, lazy folk will squawk at grammar law misapplication,<br>
  giving strong opinions of strict laws of punctuation.<br>
  Many nix all joy in words, subscribing to this faction;<br>
  in point of fact you might say it's a capital infraction.</p>
  
  <p>Every word's important in this lengthy, rambling prose.<br>
  Altering just one could lose the message that's enclosed;<br>
  please examine hard and quick the verbiage herein.<br>
  'Cause every word's important to the puzzle that it's in. </p>
  
  <p>Here's the quest that's put before you, puzzler and chum:<br>
  locate the mystery unknown; to languor don't succumb.<br>
  Search through all the text to see what's shrouded here among<br>
  the words you may enjoy or may prefer to leave unsung.</p>
  
  <p>Thus far, you'll think not much was said about this work's solution;<br>
  so you'll obtain it straight right now, without any dilution:<br>
  you want a pair of words portraying you, my puzzling buddy!<br>
  And no quick fix can find it!  No, just vim and lots of study!   </p>
  
  <p>Zest is what you'll have to have as these two words you seek;<br>
  as said before, the phrase describes a quirky puzzle geek;<br>
  just make a guess, go check your work; you'll see if it is right;<br>
  for after all, it's sure that you'll excel; you're very bright!</p>
  
  <p>As fin'lly this verbose creation's coming to a close,<br>
  please acquiesce to take my thanks for suff'ring through my prose --<br>
  my urge to wax poetic may be tiresome to some,<br>
  but still, it's rather jazzy, if your brain is not yet numb. </p>

<p>In 1980, a man lives on the 30th floor of his building. Every morning he wakes up, gets ready, kisses his wife, takes the elevator down to the first floor, and goes to work.  </p>

<p>One morning, he wakes up, gets ready, kisses his wife, and gets in the elevator, exactly as he always has done. The morning is exactly the same as any other morning, and no one else was in their apartment.  </p>

<p>The man is alone in the elevator and there are no windows in or visible from the elevator. Without receiving any  communication of any kind, or the man being in any danger of any harm, he begins crying when the elevator reaches the 12th floor, because he knows his wife has died.  </p>

<p>How is this possible?  </p>

<p>Notes (added later) to eliminate "too broad" answers: </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> His wife was alive when he left the apartment.<br>
 The man loved his wife, and would never harm her in any way.</p>

<p>And for the more extreme options: </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> The man had a boring typical day job. No danger involved.

<h2><a name="question12995"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/12995">Five coloured doors, which leads to freedom?</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">83 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5373">Rand al'Thor#5373</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/11251">Spacemonkey#11251</a></p>

<p>You have been incarcerated in a high-security prison for several nefarious crimes which we need not go into here. The warden, being a kindly logician, offers you a single chance to escape. You are blindfolded and given a choice of five doors, one of which leads to freedom and the other four to prison cells. You know that the doors are red, blue, green, yellow, and white; they are evenly spaced, each 2 paces from the next; and you are standing in front of the middle one. There is a guard standing by each door, and <em>all five guards tell the truth</em> (weren't expecting that, were you?). They make the following statements:</p>

<ul>
<li>The red door is somewhere to the left of the door leading to freedom.</li>
<li>The blue door is not at either end.</li>
<li>The green door is 3 doors away from the door leading to freedom (2 doors between them).</li>
<li>The yellow door is adjacent to the door leading to freedom.</li>
<li>The white door is the middle one.</li>
</ul>

<p>To find out how many paces you need to take to which side in order to be standing in front of the door to freedom, you need to answer the following two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What is the order of the coloured doors, left to right?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Which colour of door leads to freedom?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You may assume that all statements made about "left" and "right" refer to <em>your</em> left and right.</p>

<p>(I found more or less this puzzle on the internet and thought it would be easy, but for some reason it's a fair bit harder than it looks!)</p>

<p>Looks like <a href="https://puzzling.meta.stackexchange.com/a/6160/36023">the community has spoken</a>.</p>

<p>With a heavy heart (as if), I have trapped @Deusovi behind a never repeating, fractally recursive, infinite, unsolvable labyrinth. To keep him busy, I added a couple of teleports.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/deCDk.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/deCDk.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p><strong>The green part of the maze contains a copy of the maze, scaled down so that it exactly fits.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>A teleport is connected to every teleport of the same size. And yes. A scaled down "big teleport" is exactly the same size as a "small teleport".</strong></p>

<p>Fun facts about this puzzle:</p>

<ul>
<li>The angle of the scaled-down copy is an irrational part of $\pi$, so the angle will never repeat.</li>
<li>There are almost no dead ends. There are infinitely many distinct infinitely long mistake paths.</li>

<h2><a name="question13303"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/13303">A hunt for long forgotten treasure ...but beware the pirate's curse!</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">80 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5208">Alconja#5208</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5208">Alconja#5208</a></p>

<p>I never really knew my uncle growing up. He seemed nice enough, but I got the sense from the distant, troubled look in his eyes that there was at least some truth to the rumours...</p>

<p>Years before I was born, his fishing trawler was lost at sea under mysterious circumstances. None of his crew survived, and when pressed, he'd just mutter something about a freak storm. What is known, is that he spent several weeks adrift and when found, he was near death, babbling incoherently about pirates, treasure, and curses.</p>

<p>Anyway, my uncle passed away a few months ago, and last week, out of the blue a lawyer showed up on my doorstep with a large box that was, for some unexplained reason, left to me in his will. The box's strange contents included piles of musty, leather bound books, old tattered maps, a small brass telescope, a compass that no longer worked... It was interesting, even a little mysterious, but mostly it just seemed like junk. However, as I flipped through an old book documenting the native flora of some isolated pacific island, a small map fell to the ground...</p>

<hr>

<p>As you can see below, the map is hand drawn and shows the features of an unnamed island in exquisite detail:</p>

<p><img src="images/zaDz9.png" alt="hand drawn map"></p>

<p>More interestingly, however, is the strange riddle scrawled on the back in a delicate, spidery script:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Start your search from dead man's cave and follow the clues herein.</em><br>
  <em>Sharpen a sword and your wits and you're ready to begin.</em>  </p>
  
  <p><em>Paired up, pared down, the truth exposed, lies within lies.</em><br>
  <em>Heading onwards north, reeling seas terrorize.</em>  </p>
  
  <p><em>Right is left and left is right, turn and go until,</em><br>
  <em>Twins appear to mark an end, though you'll continue still.</em>  </p>
  
  <p><em>Cardinals sitting in their nests, pick them up one by one.</em><br>
  <em>Set them free and follow them, then turn to what's undone.</em>  </p>
  
  <p><em>A leap of faith, surrender yourself. But when things come to a head,</em><br>
  <em>Take the easy way out, with the blues left behind, go three and don't retread.</em>  </p>
  
  <p><em>Follow the gaze of the crimson saint as he looks to the pre-dawn glow.</em><br>
  <em>The distance the crow flies in to pi, hints how far to go.</em>  </p>
  
  <p><em>Two one fives, all lined up, this time point the way.</em><br>
  <em>They also indicate how far. Go now or be led astray.</em>  </p>
  
  <p><em>Proceed until, when viewed from on high, the island itself gives a sign.</em><br>
  <em>Next steps revealed as the river reflects and the ancient stones align.</em>  </p>
  
  <p><em>Run forth with what you carry. Confusion becomes clear.</em><br>
  <em>Now piece together your reward, you'll find it buried here.</em>  </p>
  
  <p><em>Be warned though treasure seeker, should you make but one wrong turn.</em><br>
  <em>The pirate's curse, and certain death, is all that you will earn...</em>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's not totally clear, but I'm pretty certain the riddle and map indicate some long forgotten pirate's treasure! Unfortunately, I've been unable to decipher any of it, and perhaps subconsciously I don't want to find the answer myself, for fear of the fate that befell my uncle and his crew... Either way, I've decided I'm turning it over to you. Good luck, but beware the pirate's curse...</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Clarifications</strong></p>

<p>To be 100% clear:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everything you need to solve this puzzle, beyond a little general knowledge, is contained in the map and riddle, the rest is just flavor text.</li>
<li>The last stanza is also just flavor, but the rest contain one or more discrete directions.</li>
<li>You can assume that you're capable of crossing rivers, climbing mountains, swimming in the ocean, etc. Basically all squares on the map are valid, but you'll never be directed off the map completely.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, if you want to keep your working to yourself initially (this is a race for the treasure after all!), feel free to just post <strong>in the comments</strong>, the coordinates you arrived at at the end of each stanza, with the last being the location of the treasure, along with what the treasure actually is. Eg. "<em>AB, CD, ..., YZ - Treasure is a pile of gold</em>". I'll then give a percentage indication of how successful you were. (obviously, when giving an actual answer, you'll need to justify those steps with valid logic though).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Hints</strong><p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(This puzzle is now solved, but I'll leave these here for prosperity, or for late comers who still want to work through the challenge)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>General hints:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>1</strong>: As @Realdeo has observed in the comments, you can't necessarily assume North is up. Maybe there's a way to confirm...<br>
 <strong>2</strong>: Don't bother looking for a clue that will tell you where dead man's cave is. Just pick a cave and start. It will become apparent as you progress if you made the right choice...<br>
 <strong>3</strong>: Almost all the stanzas are effectively standalone riddles, so if you get stuck on one you can still work on others. Though you should still be aware that sometimes things rely on you being in a specific location in order to make sense (even then, you will likely be able to "solve" and understand the stanza). Of the individual stanzas/riddles, some are wordplay, some are mini puzzles, some use the map and some are fairly direct (though muddied with metaphor).<br>
 <strong>4</strong>: No clue will ever explicitly tell you to travel diagonally or any other non-orthogonal direction. Though some stanzas will be made up of multiple individual (orthogonal) steps, making the overall movement for the stanza non-orthogonal.<br>
 <strong>5</strong>: Don't bother trying to decrypt or decode all the letters around the edge. You won't get very far, as more than half are just random fillers. You'll need certain letters at some point, but hopefully when the time comes, you'll know which ones...<br>
 <strong>6</strong>: It will make your life easier if the first thing you do is to determine where north is. You can do this before even looking at the riddle.<br>
 <strong>7</strong>: Incorporating clues given on @rand's attempt at finding North: Paying close attention to the blotches around the compass rose is a captital idea! Plus, I'm sure the pirates would have put one on all four sides if they could have, but for some reason only three have anything visible... What could make those blotches, and why would only one side not have any? ...also, perhaps it's worth thinking about what's NOT there.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stanza specific hints:  </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>Start your search</strong>: This stanza is mostly just a direct statement, so for the moment, there's not much to be gained puzzling over it (see general hint about dead man's cave above).<br>
 <strong>Paired up</strong>: The first line is the most important here, as it will help to understand the second.<br>
 <strong>Paired up</strong>: To clarify the hint above, although the first line is key, both lines still need to be used together. If the first is the key, then the second is the lock.<br>
 <strong>Paired up</strong>: You don't need to look at the map for this one, just read it very carefully, every single word should make sense once you get it.<br>
 <strong>Paired up</strong>: The solution to this stanza will be a clear, but short, sentence with a form similar to "head two north"<br>
 <strong>Paired up</strong>: People have correctly realised that there is wordplay involved here... However, beyond some slightly awkward grammar, the first line is quite literal in terms of what you need to do.<br>
 <strong>Right is left</strong>: Where you are on the map matters for this one.<br>
 <strong>Right is left</strong>: In response to @rps asking if the twins were the <code>II</code> coordinates - there's multiple possible "twins" on the map with the correct ones being validated by your movement. If you know which way north is and you've solved stanza 2, <del>you should be able to deduce/validate both dead man's cave &amp; the twins</del>.<br>
 <strong>Right is left</strong>: I slightly overstated myself in the hint above (apologies, though I doubt it sent anyone too far off track), you won't be able to 100% validate the twins and dead man's cave yet, but you will be able to narrow it down to two possibilities (one of which you'll be able to discount later).<br>
 <strong>Right is left</strong>: How would a pirate "mark and end" (particularly when we're talking about a treasure map)?<br>
 <strong>Right is left</strong>: Obviously I've made the twins a bit subtle, so when you're looking for them, consider squares as whole units... also, a pirate would need more than one set of twins to mark a spot...<br>
 <strong>Cardinals</strong>: Make sure you only free the cardinals that are actually in their nests, no others. If you get that far, what's undone should be clear.<br>
 <strong>A leap of faith</strong>: Metaphor and the map.<br>
 <strong>A leap of faith</strong>: Where you're standing and which way you're facing matter a lot here. If it makes no sense to you, you're probably standing in the wrong spot.<br>
 <strong>A leap of faith</strong>: There are multiple individual steps, but the instructions are all fairly direct (mostly just metaphor with some minor play on words, but no "tricks" like the "paired up" stanza), just make sure those blues are actually left behind when you follow the last step.<br>
 <strong>Follow the gaze</strong>: Who might the crimson saint be?<br>
 <strong>Follow the gaze</strong>: You'll need some very basic (high school level?) maths here, but currently you've almost certainly got it wrong...<br>
 <strong>Follow the gaze</strong>: The distance to go will be an integer value, with no rounding or approximating required.<br>
 <strong>Two one fives</strong>: "Two one fives" are the key here, but there are several other hints in this stanza to push you in the right direction.<br>
 <strong>Two one fives</strong>: How could "two one fives" be interpreted given the pluralisation?<br>
 <strong>Two one fives</strong>: Although "two one fives" is the key clue, the other sentence fragments are still hints. Ask yourself why I would phrase the rest of it the way I have...<br>
 <strong>Proceed until</strong>: First line is a simple directive, the second points to a mini puzzle of its own.<br>
 <strong>Run forth</strong>: What are you carrying?<br>
 <strong>Run forth</strong>: The first line is your last direction clue, the second line is talking about the treasure itself.<br>
 <strong>Run forth</strong>: "Confusion becomes clear" can be applied to the first sentence or the second line equally (and I've been dropping many hints to various people on how to discover what the treasure is).<br>
 <strong>Be warned</strong>: As stated in the clarifications, you can completely ignore this stanza.  </p>

<p><strong>Fallen heroes</strong></p>

<p>A memorial to those who were lost to the pirate's curse:</p>

<ul>
<li>Realdeo attempted <code>HT TG ES EN ES MU EI HN HS</code>, but those co-ordinates clearly spell out "THE NEMESIS HUNTS (geh)", which can't be a good sign... (with approximately 2% correct, he is now missing, presumed dead)</li>
<li>tfitzger tried <code>UE IE II SR...</code>, but luckily gave up as he had almost spelled out "[c]URSE" already! (with maybe 20% right of the 20% attempted, I can only hope he escaped the curse, but it's not looking good)

<ul>
<li>It's a miracle. He's alive and still searching, with a second attempt of <code>UE IE II CU AE...</code>. Going from "[c]URSE" to "CU[rs]E" is an improvement, but I still have my concerns.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Timur Kuchkarov has made a cautious start of <code>FE FI II...</code>, but with a low percentage correct, the "FIE" upon him may grow to something much worse.</li>
<li>After various attempts, rand al'thor settled on <code>HT DT DO EN EB EU HU RY RI</code>, but I'm worried for his safety given that the pirates seem to be trying to tell him "R! You be hurt, then died!" (grammar has never been a pirate's strong point).

<ul>
<li>It seems rand al'thor is made of tougher stuff than I thought... he survived the pirate's death threats, to find the treasure!</li>
</ul></li>

<p>A classic:</p>

<p>A CEO of a multi-million dollar business has to go on a business trip to Belgium (from somewhere in America).
Before going to the airport in the morning with his limousine, he's going to the office first to get some files that he forgot the previous night. </p>

<p>When arriving at the office, the night guard opens the gate &amp; door for him.
The CEO gets the files and drinks a coffee while chatting a bit with the guard, and he mentions that he's flying to Belgium today for a deal he cannot miss, it would bring millions of dollars to the business. </p>

<p>The night guard looks shocked, and explains why.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Guard</strong>: <em>I just had a dream this night. A plane that would fly to Belgium is going to crash in the middle of the Ocean.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The night guard begs his CEO not to go on this business trip.
And the CEO believes him. He doesn't go to the airport and cancels his flight.
Later that day, on the news, an air-plane crash... 
It was the plane that flew to Belgium. It crashed in the middle of the ocean.</p>

<p>The CEO thanks the night guard later and gives him $10.000.<br>
The CEO also tells the night guard that he's fired.</p>

<p>Jason,</p>

<p>You asked me to email you the information that we talked about, earlier, so that we had a record of it.</p>

<p>Some updates.  There was a hidden message in the letter that stated: "Helps us figure out the clue key is understand".  You're definitely going to want to work under the assumption that this is a kidnapping matter, at this point.  We'll work, further, to see if that key means anything useful, or not.</p>

<p>We also noticed that strange discrepancy, that I mentioned earlier, with the name of the image that his wife sent him.  The email stated that it had a specific name, but when we dug down into the server, it really had a different one.  I don't know that it matters, but I went ahead and modified the text, down in this email thread, so that we can reference it, later.</p>

<p>Also (which you know, since you came to see me), we spent several hours trying to figure out if the image that he sent means anything and, quite honestly, we came up blank.  I'm not sure if it will really provide us any insight, but we will, of course, keep looking, just in case I am wrong.</p>

  <p>I just wanted to write this letter, in the hopes that it he𝚕ps you to know why me and the kids are gone.  It's not about you.  It's about uѕ.  We really just need to find a way to fiɡure out how to work things o𝚞t.  Sometimes, I just think that t𝗁e problem must be that you really haven't a clu𝖾, but maybe it's me.  Maybe I'm the problem.</p>
  
  <p>Please remember that I do love you, and that's really the 𝗄ey to any relationship.  I hope this i𐑈 only temporary, and that we can come back soon, but I feel that it is entirely up to you.  Remember where we wanted to go?  I sent an image to remind you.  Please try to unⅾerstand and I will contact you in a week.  We'll take things bit by bit, but try to, at least, understand how significant this is for me.</p>
  
  <p>With love,
  Karen  </p>

<p>Whoa.  Slow down, Sam.  There's a reason that the police hold off on these kind of things.  No, I haven't seen Karen.  She didn't come in to work, this morning, either, but neither did Kyle, Jim, or the rest of my team, so he may have them off doing something that I wasn't told about, yet.  Try to calm down, and let me know if you hear from her, soon.  I'll keep an eye on my email, in case you hear anything.  </p>

<p>Don't worry about the personal matters issue.  I'll deal with that.  She is my partner, remember.</p>

<p>When I got home from work, yesterday, Karen and the kids were gone.  I waited around for a few hours, and I called her cell phone, but I couldn't get an answer.  Finally, I got tired, while waiting, and passed out.  </p>

<p>This morning, I woke up on the couch and checked the whole house again.  They're still gone!!  I called the police, but she hasn't been gone long enough for them to look into it.  I'm going nuts here, man!  Please, you've got to help me.  Please let me know if her, and the kids, are up there at you guys' work.</p>

<p>"<em>Each mirror is a world of it's own</em>," Joe explains.<br>
"<i>Joe, that's bulls***! Mirrors are just mirrors!</i>" Rita proclaims.</p>

<p><strong>Joe proceeds to lay out the following</strong>~</p>

<p>$10~Laws~of~Mirror~Universes$</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><strong>Law of Rotation:</strong> For each <strong>one</strong> orientation of a mirror (rotated spherically or in 3D space) there
  is exactly <strong>one</strong> universe perfectly symmetrical to our own.</li>
  <li><strong>Law of Quantity:</strong> There are infinite orientations possible in a sphere, so there are <strong>infinite</strong> universes parallel to our own. (<em>Sidenote: Why not just have one mirror universe? Why do we need infinite parallel ones? Because moving an entire universe when you pick up a mirror seems like a lot more work then connecting to a bunch of other ones</em>)</li>
  <li><strong>Law of Non-Uniqueness:</strong> Every universe began at the same time and progressed in the exact same way, with the exception of being "flipped" as we observe in a
  reflection. That means <strong>we are nothing special</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Law of Boundaries:</strong> The <strong>line of symmetry</strong> in each case is <strong>defined by the mirror</strong> itself.</li>
  <li><strong>Law of Congruent Copies:</strong> Changing the orientation of a mirror links to another exact replica of that mirror universe - they are all <a href="http://ceemrr.com/Geometry1/Transitive/Transitive_print.html" rel="noreferrer">congruent to each
  other through transitivity</a></li>
  <li><strong>Law of Interaction:</strong> We cannot exchange matter into these universes because for every <strong>one</strong> particle that attempts to cross the threshhold, exactly <strong>one</strong> congruent particle meets it at the barrier.</li>
  <li><strong>Law of Weak Reflectional Attraction:</strong> A weak force along the mirror accounts for substances "stuck" to each other across the threshhold. This is why mirrors can be dirty: the boundary has a slight pull that makes dirt, etc stay on the plane of the mirror instead of falling as if there was simply air.</li>
  <li><strong>Law of Rigidity and Flatness:</strong> Boundaries such as funhouse mirrors or reflections in water serve only as distorted windows; they must be flat and rigid to allow
  actual interaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Law of Heat Transfer:</strong> The <strong>medium</strong> of the mirror (metal, etc) <strong>moderates heat</strong> transfer, which is why you don't feel immediate warmth when you touch
  a mirror with your hand.</li>
  <li><strong>Law of Medium Maintenance:</strong> That which would break the mirror surface due to pressure or momentum will do so <strong>before</strong> trying to pass through. Each new shard is its own boundary.</li>
  </ol>

<p>"<em>Joe</em>," says Rita, "<em>Your 'theory' doesn't account for</em> this."<br>
Rita picks up a <strong>household object</strong> and demonstrates why mirrors are simple reflections of light, and nothing more.</p>

<p>Her demonstration produces results that would be <em>different</em> if there were multiple, congruent universes bound by mirrors (for example hitting the mirror with something that should have gone through if there were actually an alternative universe on the other side)</p>

<p>One night nine gangsters stole a gold bar. When the time came for dividing the bar, they faced a problem: two of the criminals put guns to each other's faces. Now it's up to fate whether one of them lives, they both live or both die.</p>

<p>While these two are dealing with each other, the others decide to continue dividing the gold bar. What is the minimal amount of pieces they should divide the bar into, so that no matter how things pan out, everyone can be given an equal share?</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 1</strong>:  Both gangsters blow each other's brains out.  The gold must be divided evenly among the seven remaining gangsters.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 2</strong>:  One gangster is quicker on the draw, and manages to take out his opponent.  The gold must be divided evenly among the eight remaining gangsters.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 3</strong>:  The duelling gangsters discuss their differences, come to a mutually beneficial agreement, and put away their guns.  The gold must be divided evenly among all nine gangsters.</p>

<p><img src="images/PwPQx.png" alt="PZL-SE-11R"></p>

<p>I'm going to come right out and say it: I'm kinda bored of making puzzles, but I still want those sweet, sweet imaginary internet points, so I'm phoning it in this time with a flat-pack rebus I bought at a puzzle warehouse. The only thing is, I can't really be bothered putting it together... Rather than completely waste my money though, I'm just posting it here, in case someone else wants to finish building it.</p>

<p>Above is a bog standard PZL-SE-11R puzzle socket that this rebus is compatible with (as I'm sure you've seen a million times before), and below are the instructions... Underneath that, are the puzzle components themselves.</p>

<h4>Instructions:</h4>

<p><img src="images/9XxiF.png" alt="Instructions"></p>

<h4>Components:</h4>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I already opened the puzzle, and discarded the packaging. The parts came as a pair of cubes, which opened out, ready to slot into the socket up the top (I think the makers have misunderstood the flat-pack concept). The cube that's in two pieces didn't break, but just came apart as it unfolded. I didn't pay attention to where it was originally joined, but I'm sure it won't make much difference...</p>

<p><img src="images/8ztTJ.png" alt="Components"></p>

<p>So, yeah... Feel free to finish putting it together, and then solve the resulting rebus.</p>

<p>Or not... Whatever...</p>

<p><strong><em>Edit</strong>: People <a href="https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/32703886#32703886">have solved 99% of the instructional steps in chat</a>, but seem to have got stuck on the final rebus itself. So to nudge things along,</em></p>

<h2><a name="question7701"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/7701">10 Prisoners, 10 Keys, and 7 Years</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">71 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/4765">Milo Brandt#4765</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/8739">keymaster#8739</a></p>

<p>One day, the warden of a prison is, like most wardens in puzzles, feeling a little bit capricious and decides that he wants to get rid of his prisoners, one way or another. He gathers all the prisoners in the yard and explains to them - "Tonight, I will go to each of you, hand you a key, and tell you who has your key. Each day after that, while the others are out of the cells and no one is watching, I will allow each of you to place your key in someone else's cell - and each night, you may collect the keys in your own cell. If, at any point, you are certain that everyone has the key to their own cell, you may summon me, at which point each of you will open your own cell and walk free. If anyone has the wrong key, everyone will be executed then and there. You may discuss your strategy before tonight, but afterwards no communication will be allowed regarding my game. - Oh, and by the way, if you are still here seven years from today, I will execute everyone - it'll be a big birthday for me and I want to retire!"</p>

<p>That night, just as promised, the warden went to each cell and gave each prisoner a key. As he handed each prisoner the key, he whispered to them the name of the person possessing the key to their cell. The keys were entirely indistinguishable from one another, but that was okay, because the prisoners had not counted on being able to tell anything about them. Indeed, the prisoners all seemed confident.</p>

<p>Each day for the nearly seven years, the prisoners all anonymously gave the key in their possession to someone else. Then, hardly a month before the deadline, a prisoner shouted to the warden that they were ready. All the prisoners were certain that they would live, and, lo and behold, when they put the keys in the locks to their cells, every cell opened.</p>

<p>What was their strategy? Exactly how many days did it take?</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong></p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> The warden had learned this from his own days as a prisoner, when the same challenge was issued to him and just two other prisoners. It took only six days of trading keys before they were released.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Oops, turns out my prisoners were kind of dumb in their choice of strategy. (If anyone wants to puzzle out what I was thinking of, the information in the post about <em>should</em> be sufficient - but I consider the puzzle, and this question to more about the most efficient way to do it). The prisoners, if wise, can be free in less than a fortnight.</p>

<p>I remember answering this one incorrectly and when the answer was explained to me I was annoyed with myself.  Here is your chance, with the original word phrasing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jack is looking at Anne, but Anne is looking at George. Jack is married, but George is not. Is a married person looking at an unmarried person?</p>
  
  <p>A) Yes<br>
  B) No<br>
  C) Cannot be determined  </p>

<p>The first with the correct alternative with the correct logical explanation ... (you know the drill).  </p>

<h2><a name="question455"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/455">Why does this solution guarantee that the prince knocks on the right door to find the princess?</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">67 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/10">WendiKidd#10</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/320">CaptainRad#320</a></p>

<p>I found this puzzle <a href="http://www.folj.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=12849">online</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the top floor of a castle lives a princess. The floor has 17 bedrooms arranged in a row. Each bedroom has doors connecting to the adjoining bedrooms as well as to the outside corridor. The princess sleeps in a different bedroom each night by opening the door to an adjoining bedroom and spending the night and the next day in that room. </p>
  
  <p>One day a prince arrives at the castle and is desirous of marrying the princess. The guardian angel at the castle tells him of the princess' sleeping patterns and informs him that each morning he may knock on one of the outside doors. If the princess happens to be behind that door, she will open it and consent to marry him. The prince also has a return ticket to his kingdom in 30 days, so he can make at most 30 attempts. Can the prince win the hand of the princess, and if so, what is his strategy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An unstated assumption here is that the princess can move to <em>any</em> adjacent room (she's not restricted to moving in one direction). So a possible sequence could be 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2... </p>

<p>Further down the thread at the link, this solution is given:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Prince should knock on the second door from one of the ends of the corridor (call it door #2), and knock on the next adjacent door each successive day until he reaches the second door from the opposite end of the corridor (door #16). The day after that, he should begin the same process in reverse order (meaning he will knock on the 16th door two days in a row). By the time he reaches his starting point (door #2 on the 30th day), he will have found the princess. </p>
  
  <p>Number the doors 1 thru 17.<br>
  If the princess occupies an even numbered room on the day the prince first knocks on a door (#2), then she will either occupy the same room he knocks on or she will be an even number of rooms away. Since both move to an adjacent room each day, this will hold true so she will never be in a room adjacent to the one he knocks on, and thus never be in a position to move past him the next day. She will have nowhere else to go by the time he reaches the 16th door, and will have by then been located. If she, on the other hand, was in an odd numbered room when he began, then she will be in an even numbered room when the prince starts the process again on day 16 (when he knocks on door #16 the second time).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've been trying to follow the solution, but I don't quite get it. The main assumption the logic in the solution seems to hinge on is this: <strong>"she will never be in a room adjacent to the one he knocks on, and thus never be in a position to move past him the next day."</strong> I can't figure out what evidence from the puzzle supports that assumption. If we begin knocking at door #2 and the princess is in room #3, our next move (following this solution) will be to knock on door #3. But at this point the princess could have moved to room #2, and we will keep moving to higher numbered rooms, and the princess could easily remain in the lower-numbered rooms. </p>

<p>So I'm having trouble understanding why this is the solution. Can someone explain it more clearly/in a different manner? Why will this process ensure the princess is found?</p>

<h2><a name="question12119"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/12119">Coin Flipping Game with the Devil</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">65 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/10615">Mike Earnest#10615</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/1752">Lopsy#1752</a></p>

<p>You die, and awake in Hell. Satan awaits you, and has prepared a curious game. He has arranged $n$ quarters in a line, going in the east/west direction. He placed the coins at the ends tails up, and all others heads up, like so:
$$
\text{T H H H }\cdots \text{ H H H T}
$$</p>

<p>Satan explains the rules.</p>

<ul>
<li>Once a day, a coin is removed from the east end, and placed on the west end.
<ul>
<li>If the coin was initially tails-up, then <em>you</em> get to choose whether the coin is placed heads up or down.</li>
<li>If it was initially heads-up, then Satan gets to make this choice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If the coins are all heads up at the end of a day, you get to leave Hell.</li>
</ul>

<p>Satan will of course try his hardest to make sure you never leave.</p>

<p>For example, when $n=5$, we start with $\text{T H H } \color{red}{\text H} \color{green}{\text{ T}}$. The first day is your choice; if you choose heads, the arrangement becomes $\color{green}{\text{H }}\text{T H H } \color{red}{\text H} $. The next three days, however, will be Satan's choice. He may fight back on the second day by choosing tails, resulting in $\color{red}{\text{T } }\color{green}{\text{H }}\text{T H H }  $.</p>

<p>Is there a strategy that eventually guarantees your salvation? Or can Satan conspire to keep you in Hell forever? </p>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> To give credit where it is due, this puzzle from <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/puzzle/">The Puzzle Toad</a>, (under the name "Zeroise Me") which is a superb collection of similarly clever and enjoyable conundrums.</p>

<p>Alice is in the most puzzling part of Wonderland yet. Following the white rabbit, she emerged found herself in the middle of a hedge maze. The rabbit provided her with a map before scurrying off, but it only seemed to make her more confused. She needs your help to figure out how to escape the maze.</p>

<p>The maze has 12 potential exits, numbered on the map. Each of the squares labeled A, B, C and D represent <strong>smaller copies of the entire maze</strong>. These submazes each have their own submazes, like infinitely many nested Matryoshka dolls, except that every doll has four dolls nested inside it.  </p>

<p>Below the map is a bird's eye view of the actual maze, where you can see how the passages become smaller and smaller in a fractal fashion (only three levels of recursion are actually pictured). Fortunately, Alice has an ample supply of cakes and elixirs to change her size as necessary. </p>

<p>One last note: the little orange curve between B and D is a bridge which can be crossed over and walked under, but jumping from the bridge to the path below is not allowed.  </p>

<p>You are a prisoner in a room with 2 doors and 2 guards. One of the doors will guide you to freedom and behind the other is a hangman --you don't know which is which.</p>

<p>One of the guards always tells the truth and the other always lies. You don't know which one is the truth-teller or the liar either.</p>

<p>You have to choose and open one of these doors, but you can only ask a single question to one of the guards.</p>

<p>What do you ask so you can pick the door to freedom?</p>

<p>The town of Squareshire has six streets: four sides of a square and the lines joining the midpoints of opposite sides.</p>

<p>$\hskip2in$<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/odSRh.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/odSRh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>A policeman is chasing a thief along these streets. If they are ever on the same street, then the policeman can shoot the thief. The policeman runs slightly faster than twice the thief (say 2.0001 times the speed of the thief). How can he shoot the thief?</p>

<p><em>Source: Moscow mathematical Olympiad, 1978</em></p>

<h3>Clarification:</h3>

<p>The squares between the streets contain houses and walls, so the policeman can't see the thief unless they're on the same street. He has no idea about the exact location and strategy used by the thief.  </p>

<p>For obvious reasons, Bob was rather confused for a while. He realized that in their entire conversation she had never said her name. </p>

<p>All the same, he began trying to figure out the message she had written him. He was beginning to despair but then as he finished working out what she had written him, he immediately knew her name and called her number the first chance he got.</p>

<p>You've trekked through jungle and tundra, across mountaintops and deserts, into giant caverns and beneath the ocean to find the person known as <strong>The Oracle.</strong> Finally, after all your hard work, you find him. He sits alone in an opulent palace, never moving, never blinking, allowing each visitor to ask <em>one</em> question of him. You take a moment to catch your breath after climbing the steps to his throne, gather yourself, and ask:</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of life?"</p>

<p>You were told that he would answer one question for each person, and this question has been nagging on your mind.</p>

<p>What you were <em>not</em> told is that his answers were not quite straightforward.</p>

<p>As he begins to speak, you scramble to grab your notepad and begin writing. At the end of his message to you, you read back what he's said. "What?", you ask out loud, audibly confused.</p>

<p>Of course, The Oracle does not answer.</p>

<p>Can you discover the meaning of life from The Oracle's message?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>HINT 1:</strong></p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> The Oracle speaks quite cryptically, don't you think? <em>(I've added a new tag to the puzzle that should add some clarification to it. Hopefully that should give you some idea as to how the puzzle should be solved - and more importantly, some knowledge on how it shouldn't.)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>HINT 2:</strong></p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> The two most important words to figuring out this puzzle's big gimmick are "definitively twisted". </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Stanza-Specific Hints:</strong></p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>Stanza 1:</strong> This couplet gives you a key cryptic crossword indicator, but don't get caught up on the result making any sense. In fact, the couplet tells you exactly which words to use and which to avoid. Keep in mind somewhere in there is a definition!<br>
 <strong>Stanza 2:</strong> Pretty much everyone has identified 'u' and 'i' from this couplet, and you're all on the right track. Most of the words in this couplet aren't indicative of words, <em>per se.</em><br>
 <strong>Stanza 3:</strong> If five becoming square actually meant the number 25, that wouldn't lead to confusion at all, would it? Harry Potter's version of the basilisk is not the only one out there.<br>
 <strong>Stanza 4:</strong> The last number reference leads to confusion. This one does not. Make sure you're counting aloud. To figure out the rest of the couplet, getting out a pen and paper and illustrating might help.<br>
 <strong>Stanza 5:</strong> I already mentioned that 'in our dreams' is just in this couplet as a rhyming mechanism. There's only one other place where I do that, and I'll identify it. The cryptic here has already been solved. Which words weren't part of it? Those may help you with another stanza...<br>
 <strong>Stanza 6:</strong> This one is a fairly straightforward clue. Open your cryptic-solving mind, remember the gimmick of the puzzle, and look for a keyword or two to get things going.<br>
 <strong>Stanza 7:</strong> You already know at least one word here that doesn't belong with this couplet. The rest of the couplet should be easily solvable, especially if you don't worry about the definition until you solve the cryptic.<br>
 <strong>Stanza 8:</strong> Will 'truly help you see' truly help you see? Not really.<br>
 <strong>Stanza 9:</strong> The first line means two things. You already know what 'definitively twisted' means, which is a good start. 'In the shadows' is a reference to the cryptic clues, which are apparently aligned <em>so</em> clearly! I'm surprised you missed it.<br>
<br>
 <strong>All stanzas:</strong> You will find pretty quickly that the words all share a specific property. It's not an obscure property, either (I promise).<br>
 <strong>All stanzas:</strong> The best way to approach this puzzle is to solve a stanza's cryptic clue, find its definition, then solve <em>that</em> stanza's cryptic clue with the words in the previous stanza's definition excluded (obviously); lather, rinse, repeat. Luckily, you've already been given a head-start with both a cryptic clue solved and its definition identified.</p>

<a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/36256/this-is-it-this-is-the-one-find-your-wife">You now know where your wife is</a>, so you hop on a plane and fly over to France. You reach the house and burst through the front door, only to find the house deserted. In despair, you slump into a chair in the kitchen. You then notice a note pinned to the table in front of you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To xxxxx,</p>
  
  <p>/</p>
  
  <p>Now it seems you misunderstood me, despite my letters to you. I don’t need any help, although I’m happy you came. I told you to please not come looking, but it appears you have anyway. Honestly, again, you have to return.</p>
  
  <p>I’ve been forced to disappear. You must go back to the family to make them see. Make sure you <em>check</em> on the kids, and do not forget, before going home.</p>
  
  <p>Care for my family. This will not be easy for them to take. Tell them I was hiding after being afraid someone was coming, and that I ran. I was scared, but over time <em>the</em> fear reduced and I became less and less cautious so I then left my carers when things got out of hand. When I heard you were coming to find me before trying to save me I had to return to them and to hiding. We couldn’t afford to meet.</p>
  
  <p>Enough of that, I don’t have much more time to write each of these letters. This, with life having gone into reverse, I expect will be my <em>last</em> letter to you. But I hope that sometime I can, you have my word, come back.</p>
  
  <p>Think of me often and hope our next meeting is soon. Our relationship was just absolutely unimaginable, the best possible, I thank you a lot for that of course. I really am extremely thankful, our life was first class and fantastic.</p>
  
  <p>Really must hurry now, can’t say the reason why but I really have to go. To be truthful there’s so much more I want to say to you but I can’t, for one thing that’s straight forward - my dinner’s going cold. So’s my tea.</p>
  
  <p>You can move but will always, and hopefully one day once again can be my husband, you know that already without these words. Remember I love you. This is one of, or the hardest thing I probably have ever done, I’m short of breath, trying not to get tear drops over these <em>letters</em>, or even worst and the very thing I want last, over my writing. It’s really hard not to sob.</p>

  <p>Love from me,</p>

<p>Realising that your wife may be here after all you get up and look in the next room to find a page of what appears to be algebra. You also <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16WbfElgUrSNUChd88JI6bf8Uc_j1hrviHkehEeeNN1E/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noreferrer">put it in a spreadsheet</a> so its easier to look at, though the formating isn't as good.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GmT2Y.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/GmT2Y.png" alt="updated algebra"></a></p>

<p>Expecting more, you go upstairs and find a page ripped from a book. You take a glance at it. It seems to be from Great Expectations by Charles Dickens, but you suspect the letters themselves are more important than the book...</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g6216.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/g6216.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>And lastly you find a load of supposingly meaningless letters scrawled on the wall upstairs. You write them down:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Smi semo dllam olive sr etirp,<br>

<p>There's a cool new cybercafé in town called <code>#DECAFE</code></p>

<p>The café charges a fee to use their computers, but if you BYOC (bring your own computer) you can get on their internet free with any purchase... if you know how!</p>

<p>After you pay, the cashier says a sentence. If you reply with the correct number, they will hand you a slip with credentials.</p>

<p>You eavesdrop as the four people in front of you acquire internet credentials:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cashier:</strong> Aloof whale swim forth.<br>
  <strong>Customer #1:</strong> One</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cashier:</strong> Tasty warm pasties contain stuff.<br>
  <strong>Customer #2:</strong> Two</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cashier:</strong> Pinkish fish adds distinct flavour on your bagel: robust smack.<br>
  <strong>Customer #3:</strong> Three</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, you figure it's easy enough, but then you're thrown for a loop when the next number is not four.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cashier:</strong> Toxic frogs dispatch.<br>
  <strong>Customer #4:</strong> Sixty</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After you've made your purchase, the cashier says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our cat can lick ice, you know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What number must you say to obtain internet credentials?</strong></p>

<h4>Clarification</h4>

<p>The challenge-response format is just intended to be a fun wrapper (and to make solving the puzzle easier by providing explicit known hidden messages): the challenges conceal the appropriate responses plainly using steganographic methods.</p>

<h4>Hints</h4>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <code>#DECAFE</code> <em>is</em> a color as pointed out in the comments, but that's not what counts.</p>

  <p> Every <em>word</em> is important, but only a handful of <em>letters</em> are meaningful.</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> The spelling of a number (in English) is relevant in at least one challenge. Not all numbers are represented the same way.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> The cat could also pour ale without changing your answer. Similarly, the pasties could also contain pilaf, but not meats. Moreover, the whale could instead be a goose or a drake or <em>possibly</em> a manatee, but not an otter or a squid.</p>

<h2><a name="question17510"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/17510">The Jeweller's Dilemma</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">56 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5373">Rand al'Thor#5373</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/4551">xnor#4551</a></p>

<p>You are well known as the best jeweller in Puzzovania; your shop is always well stocked and your pockets are always bulging.</p>

<p>One day, the local 'godfather' of Puzzovania's organised crime comes into your shop. Naturally, you owe him a favour - who doesn't in these parts? He hands you a diamond the size of a hen's egg and tells you what he requires from you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"This is for my daughter. She's getting married - you understand? I want her to have the best-cut diamond in the whole of Puzzovania. It's family honour."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You nod mutely, inspecting the diamond in awe. It's the biggest one you've ever seen. You decide it would be more prudent not to ask where the diamond came from.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"So listen, my friend. The diamond needs to be cut to the shape of a <strong>convex polyhedron</strong>. Any size and shape; that doesn't matter. What matters is that <strong>every face of the polyhedron needs to have a different number of sides</strong>. My daughter's such a changeable character - never quite the same person twice. I want her jewel to reflect that. Do you think you can manage that for me?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Of ... of course, Godfather," you stammer. Once that imposing gentleman has taken his leave, you sit down, still holding the diamond, and wonder how you're going to do it. You need to call in a mathematician ... or possibly a puzzler!</p>

<p><strong>Can you satisfy the Godfather's wishes?</strong> If so, construct a polyhedron as required (and prepare your best suit, since he'll probably invite you to the wedding as a reward). If not, prove the non-existence of such a polyhedron (and book your flight out of the country, to somewhere far enough away to be out of the reach of his power).</p>

<p><sub>(Note: this puzzle sounds much better if you read all the Godfather's words in Marlon Brando's voice.)</sub></p>

<p><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/2497/whats-the-password">War has broken out in the kingdom.</a> The king's castle is guarded pretty heavily, by guards with instructions to kill anyone who can't produce the correct password.</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to the guards, the beggars near the main gate are in fact enemy spies. They listen intently as the first knight approaches. "Six!", the guard calls out. "Three," answers the knight. He is allowed through. "Aha," the spies think.</p>

<p>But they needs to be sure. They see another knight approaching and listen in on his exchange with the guard. "Twelve!", "Six!"</p>

<p>One spy decides he's heard enough, so he leaves and returns dressed as a knight. "Eighteen!" The spy answers "nine" and is killed on the spot by the guards.</p>

<p>Another spy, who used to browse Puzzling.SE before he signed up for the Espionage Division feels a moment of deja vu, and decides he now knows the answer. As night falls, he goes off and disguises himself as a knight. He comes back in the morning and walks up to the guard.</p>

<p>"Eighteen!" shouts the guard, "Eight!" the spy replies. The guard cuts him down, and he makes a surprised "gurgle...splot" noise as he dies.</p>

<p>The last spy, still in hiding is confused. As he's thinking, another knights walks up. "Twelve!" is the challenge, "Zero!" comes the reply. The guard steps aside and the knight enters.</p>

<p>Finally, the last spy gets up, goes off and does the whole dress-as-a-knight thing and comes back. "Eighteen!" shouts the guard. What is the correct response?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The answer to TWELVE could have been Zero or Six either time - both were correct. This is one of only two such cases of 2 valid answers.</p>

<p><strong>Edit for anyone who sees this in the future:</strong> I'm aware that it's not fully-scoped. It's my first puzzle and I neglected to give any odd-number examples, which is kind of important. It's totally solvable without them, I just should have included at least one.</p>

<h2><a name="question14758"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/14758">Wanted: Family of 6</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">55 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/463">JLee#463</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/4479">JS1#4479</a></p>

<p>After many years, authorities are still looking for a family of 6, five of whom are suspected of many multiple-country border crossings with no passports or proper identification. Although no known damage has been done, the homeland security divisions of many countries are irate, and continue "to spend much time and money until these 6 are found and punished."</p>

<p>A recent tip led investigators to believe that 5 of the 6 are still actively on the run, and that these 5 meet with the 6th member (believed to be the leader) at the same time each day, presumably to plan future evasion tactics. However, no sightings of any of the 6 have been documented, leaving authorities puzzled.</p>

<p>On multiple occasions, top intelligence in many different countries led several police forces to some of the family members' projected locations, but each time officers have reported an eerie feeling of 1 or more members of the family being extremely close to them, yet none were seen.</p>

<p><strong>The official, but limited, suspect information:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Priscilla, mother and leader, at least 8 counts of trespassing, claims her children are not doing any harm, and that she has trained them on the straight and narrow path their whole lives</li>
  <li>Ed, tallest sibling, 13 counts of trespassing, the most famous of the 5 siblings worldwide</li>
  <li>Caitlin, 17 counts of trespassing</li>
  <li>Cadence, twin sister of Caitlin, at least 12 counts of trespassing</li>
  <li>Arnold, 8 counts of trespassing</li>
  <li>Anthony, twin brother of Arnold, multiple counts of aiding and abetting</li>
  </ol>

<p>You're sitting at your Alphabet City Police Department sergeant's desk on a normal Wednesday when the phone rings.</p>

<p>"Oh my god, oh my god!  Please help me.  It's my pet word. It's been, well, I don't know exactly, but...oh, the <em>horror!</em>" says a frightened voice.</p>

<p>"Calm down, sir.  Please tell me what happened."</p>

<p>"I didn't see it.  But others did.  Just come down to the intersection of Character and Grapheme.  SOON. Please!  The poor little thing.  Only <strong>four letters long</strong> and then this happens..."</p>

<p>You hang up the phone and glance at the pile of DUIs and B&amp;Es looming on your desk, and can't keep a sigh from escaping.  You didn't get into Letter Policing for this, sitting at a desk day after day, going through the motions...  Even if this story turns out to be gibberish, at least it's something unusual.  You grab your coat.</p>

<p>"I'm heading downtown."</p>

<hr>

<p>Your ABCPD squad car pulls up at the intersection of Character and Grapheme, and you step out.  Several cars are already on the scene, and the crowd is clearly disturbed; you spot one man kneeling near a wall, fighting with each breath not to be sick again.</p>

<p>A junior officer runs up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Sarge, thank goodness you're here.  I've been taking eyewitness accounts.  Apparently this guy tied up his pet word while he was shopping for vowels.  Then a gang showed up, four words in all, and started harassing the pet word."  </p>
  
  <p>"You sure it was a gang?" you ask.  </p>
  
  <p>"Yes, sir.  Witnesses all agree the four words were related.  But then someone called the cops and the gang panicked.  Apparently, to stop themselves from being recognized, the gang viciously ripped apart the pet word, then each gang member <strong>took one of the letters from the pet word, added it to himself, and rearranged his letters to make a new word</strong>."  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You understand why the man was fighting to keep his lunch down.  You swallow hard, and focus on the facts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"What then?"  </p>
  
  <p>"Well, each of the disguised gang members fled in a different direction.  We got here ASAP though, so each one only made it a block before we showed up."</p>
  
  <p>"Okay, so they're still in the area."  </p>
  
  <p>"Yes, sir. But...well, it seems that they've further disguised themselves."  </p>
  
  <p>"Dammit!  How!?"  </p>
  
  <p>"Well, the one who fled north came to a law-abiding group of words having a meeting.  He heard sirens, and knew he didn't have time to flee anymore.  He also knew that he'd be caught if he tried to blend in with the group, since they were all similar to one another and he wasn't.  So instead..."</p>
  
  <p>"Spit it out, officer."  </p>
  
  <p>"It seems, sir, that <strong>he split himself up into letters, and added one letter to each of the words in the group.  He then forced them to rearrange themselves to disguise their relationship</strong> so he could blend in."  </p>
  
  <p>"Diabolical.  What about the other three?"  </p>
  
  <p>"Same thing, sir, but they just ran in different directions, and found different groups to hide in."  </p>
  
  <p>"So where are these poor innocents who have been dragged into this mess now?"  </p>
  
  <p>"We've got them all detained, sir.  Waiting for you to inspect them."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's for days like this that you always carry TUMS.  You tilt your head back and drop in enough to quell your body's natural reaction to this senseless butchering.  The four groups of words await your interrogation.  You stop and think about the facts.  Focus on the facts, not that poor little 4-letter pet...</p>

<p>If—you reason—you go to each group of words, you should be able to <strong>remove a letter from each, then rearrange the remaining letters into words that are related...those will yield the law-abiding groups who were unwittingly brought into this mess.  The letters you remove from each group will form the disguised gang members.  If you can then remove a letter from each of those disguised gang members, and rearrange the leftovers, you'll reveal the identity of the gang and its members...and more importantly you can stitch the removed letters back together</strong>, and give this guy his pet word back.</p>

<p>Well, you may not be the greatest letter detective in history, but today you're damn well going to make a difference.</p>

<h2><a name="question55600"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/55600">Can you open the bathroom door?</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">53 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/40607">sousben#40607</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/9422">Lawrence#9422</a></p>

<p>This happened to me in a rental apartment and I had to be creative to solve it.</p>

<p>The <strong>geniuses</strong> who designed the bathroom managed to fit a drawer about a centimeter behind the door, and eventually what had to go wrong went wrong: the drawer was full of stuff and once we closed the door, the drawer reopened a bit,  blocking the door from opening more than about a centimeter, blocking us from entering the bathroom.</p>

<p><strong>Position 1</strong><br>
The setup when the door is closed and the drawer is closed normally (view from above)</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bvmUp.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/bvmUp.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p><strong>Position 2</strong><br>
This is what happened when the drawer blocked the door:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k14TG.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/k14TG.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>This only left about a centimeter of leeway for opening the door from outside  </p>

<p>Not enough to let daylight go through, but enough for me to be able to get the drawer to open even more by pushing the door back and forth.
And because of the form factor of the drawer (the front panel being a couple of centimeters larger than the drawer itself, I felt the more the drawer would open, the more I could open the door, to the point that I could actually get a finger in.</p>

<p><strong>Position 3</strong><br>
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zzAx7.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/zzAx7.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Using a metal hanger, I could manage to open the drawer even more, or close it a bit, but closing it would make the front panel of the drawer apply pressure to the door, eventually bringing me back to Position 2, where I couldn't fit anything in anymore to close the drawer further.  </p>

<p>I spoke to the locksmith who said he could make a hole in the door in order to close the drawer. This would mean I'd have to replace the door afterwards, for a price of about 100$.</p>

<p>I decided to first test my puzzle solving skills and figure out a <strong>significantly cheaper</strong> way of closing it.  </p>

<p>Other elements that may or may not be useful:<br>
- the door handle was situated above the drawer, too high to touch it or anything<br>
- the bottom of the door was about half a centimeter above the floor, letting daylight go through<br>
- lifting the door up its hinge was not an option because unless fully opened, the frame would block it<br>
- I lived in a city with all kinds of shops where I could buy all kinds of tools or accessories<br>
- I lived on a third floor, and there were bars to the window of the bathroom, meaning no human would be able to get in, even with a high enough ladder, and the window was closed anyway  </p>

<p><strong>Could you find a way to open the door without breaking anything?</strong></p>

<p><em>EDITS</em><br>
- I only drew one side of the door frame, but it was the same step-shape on both sides as well as on top, preventing access to the hinge for example<br>
- the drawers don't have handles. I only put them on the picture for illustration, so that people understand they are drawers :-)<br>
- taking the drawer out of its rails is not an option, because it needs to lift it with both hands, also, falling on the floor would most likely break it, which I wanted to avoid  </p>

I'm excited to see if somebody knows the riddle or if not, how you approach the solution.</em></p>

<p>Three mathematicians are in prison. Each of them is in a single cell and they are not able to communicate in any way. They are imprisoned for an arbitrary number of days.</p>

<p>Each cell has a single light bulb that is either on or off on a given day. The warden tells the mathematicians that the light system of the prison has three modes: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>neutral</strong> mode, where each lightbulb is independent of the others</li>
<li><strong>bright</strong> mode, where two bulbs turn <em>on</em> every day and the other turns <em>off</em></li>
<li><strong>dark</strong> mode, where two bulbs turn <em>off</em> every day and the other turns <em>on</em></li>
</ul>

<p>(All distributions are not necessarily uniform.)</p>

<p>The prison starts in <strong>neutral</strong> mode. After an unknown but finite number of days, the warden will select either <strong>bright</strong> mode or <strong>dark</strong> mode, which is locked in permanently.</p>

<p>After countably infinitely many days have passed, the mathematicians are asked which one the warden picked. They may discuss strategy before going into the cells, but there will be no communication afterwards. They have unlimited capacities to communicate and remember strategies that they come up with. Two of the three need to guess correctly to escape; how can they ensure this? <em>You may assume that the axiom of choice holds.</em></p>

(Cook was most annoyed with you for taking so many infinite bags of pastries yesterday, and has since cut off your supply).  All the other guests at the tea party shall only receive tea.</p>

<p>So now you must decide which of your many guests will be the Guest of Honor, who receives the coveted strawberry pastry.</p>

<p>Your first instinct, of course, is to invite the valiant Mr. Bun to be the Guest of Honor.  After all, he's brave and noble and always tells the truth.  But then you think of poor insidious Duke Froggington II, who admittedly is dastardly and always lies, but in your heart you know that these character flaws are only due to his tragic childhood.  You see, the perfidious Duke Froggington II grew up all alone in a dank 30-meter well, trying to leap his way to light and freedom.  You know what that's like, and your heart aches for him.  And there are similar reasons why you might choose almost any of the six dozen other stuffed animals that pack every available surface in your bedroom.</p>

<p>No, you find that you're completely unable to decide which stuffed animal should be the Guest of Honor at your tea party, and so you instead devise a game for the stuffed animals to play, to determine the Guest of Honor fairly.</p>

<p>The game works in this way:</p>

<p>First, you choose Mr. Bun as the initial nominee as Guest of Honor.  He's the obvious first candidate, as the noblest of all your stuffed animals.</p>

<p>Then, starting with the nefarious Duke Froggington II and descending through the other stuffed animals in order of seniority and ending with Peanut (an ugly mouse given to you by your annoying older sister at your last birthday fête, and usually tucked far back in your dresser behind your latin coursebooks), each stuffed animal still in attendance is asked if they wish to declare themselves to be the new nominee as Guest of Honor.  If they do, then they become the new nominee, and the previous nominee is returned to the toy chest, where they must remain until after the tea party.</p>

<p>Whenever the nominee changes, the whole process starts again;  Every animal (in order of seniority, and starting with the most senior remaining animal) is given a fresh opportunity to nominate themselves, even if they had previously chosen not to.  As before, if an animal chooses to nominate themselves, the current nominee is returned to the toy chest, and may not attend the tea party.</p>

<p>This process continues until no further stuffed animals wish to declare themselves as the nominee.</p>

<p>Once no more stuffed animals wish to make themselves the nominee, whoever remains as the nominee shall become the Guest of Honor and will receive a strawberry pastry at the tea party.  The other remaining stuffed animals shall receive tea.  Any stuffed animals in the toy chest get nothing. (At least, not until they're brought out again for the next tea party (which will likely be in ten minutes or so))</p>

<p>A few obvious points which you know instinctively are:</p>

<ul>
<li>All stuffed animals <em>love</em> strawberry pastries (as does everyone of refinement and distinction.  Peanut would probably love strawberry pastries too, despite having neither refinement nor distinction, though you've certainly never wasted one on her, even yesterday when you had several infinite supplies of them).  This means that each stuffed animal dearly wishes to be the Guest of Honor.</li>
<li>All stuffed animals like tea, so none of them wish to completely miss the party by being put back into the toy chest.</li>
<li>All stuffed animals are perfect logicians (I mean, obviously.  Do I even need to mention this?)</li>
<li>Stuffed animals don't hold grudges against one another;  they will remain fast friends even if one sends another to the toy chest.  On the contrary, they will recognise that it was the only logical thing to do, and will probably laugh about it at your next tea party, later this afternoon.</li>
<li>While the treacherous Duke Froggington II always lies, you've long since adapted to that, and aren't ever confused any more about what he means when he tells you which door leads to certain doom and which leads to your afternoon Latin classes (though you're still not convinced that there's actually much of a difference between the two).  Similarly, there will be no confusion on your part about whether or not he wishes to become the new nominee, regardless of what lies he might say.</li>
<li>For the sake of clarity, you have six dozen and two stuffed animals in total.  With Mr. Bun as your favourite, the despicable Duke Froggington II as your second favourite, and Peanut as your least favourite.  Other stuffed animals may be identified by number, with the next animal after the treacherous Duke Froggington II being number 3.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Of your stuffed animals, how many will attend your tea party, and which will be the Guest of Honor?</strong></p>

<h2><a name="question23150"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/23150">How to beat Count Dracula</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">52 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/8874">Gamow#8874</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/16608">The Dark Truth#16608</a></p>

<p>Abraham Van Helsing and Jonathan Harker play a game against Count Dracula.
The three players agree on the following rules:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Count Dracula and Van Helsing enter the crypt, while Jonathan Harker has to wait outside. The crypt contains 1000 coffins that are numbered from 1 up to 1000, together with 1000 golden lockets that are engraved with the numbers from 1 to 1000.
  Each of the numbers from 1 to 1000 occurs on exactly one coffin and on exactly one locket.</p></li>
  <li><p>Count Dracula puts the lockets into the coffins, so that every coffin contains exactly one locket. Van Helsing observes this, and knows exactly which locket is in which coffin.</p></li>
  <li><p>Now it is Van Helsing's turn:  Van Helsing may (but does not have to) pick a pair of coffins and switch the lockets in these two coffins. Dracula observes the action of Van Helsing.</p></li>
  <li><p>Van Helsing now leaves the crypt through the back door. Jonathan Harker (who has gained no additional knowledge over the choices of Dracula and Van Helsing in the first three steps) enters the crypt.</p></li>
  <li><p>Count Dracula chooses an integer $N$ with $1\le N\le1000$, and announces $N$ to Jonathan.</p></li>
  <li><p>Jonathan is allowed to perform 500 search steps of the following form: Jonathan chooses a coffin, opens it, and checks whether the locket in this coffin carries the number $N$.</p></li>
  <li><ul>
  <li>If Jonathan Harker finds the locket with number $N$ during his 500 search steps, then he and Van Helsing have won the game. In this case, they are allowed to drive a wooden stake through Dracula's heart.  </li>
  <li>If Harker does not manage to find the locket with number $N$, then Count Dracula is allowed to drink Van Helsing's and Harker's blood to the last remaining drop.</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Harker and Van Helsing discuss their options and want to agree on a good strategy.
If Harker chooses his 500 coffins simply at random, then the team Harker &amp; Van Helsing has a 50% probability of winning the game.  Is there a strategy that would guarantee them an even better probability of success?</p>

<p>I want to share one more chapter of the puzzle crime story I make for my website. All of the information for solving this puzzle is contained in the text and the image below. As usual, any feedback will be highly appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the moment Sanders entered the hut, the electricity inside got
  turned on. A bulb lightened up the small room and revealed a man in a
  cage, desperately trying to escape. The man looked at the detective
  and said:</p>
  
  <p>"You should be Sanders? Some crazy man kidnapped me and locked me
  here. He said that once you enter, you have exactly 13 minutes to set
  me free. After that the entire place will blow up. Please hurry, we
  need to figure out the correct 4-digit combination which unlocks the
  safe over there. The key which opens my cage is inside."</p>
  
  <p>Sanders listened carefully, tried to calm the person down to best of
  his abilities, then started examining the room. He could see Teddy's
  peculiarities all around - a pair of mismatching shoes on the ground,
  a picture flipped upside down on the wall, three old electronic
  clocks, negligently thrown around... He noticed that even though the
  clocks were functional, all of them were few hours wrong, and also 15
  of their segments were not working. The detective wondered for a
  moment why Teddy would even keep such useless items, then focused his
  attention on the safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sanders spent the next few minutes trying to figure out the correct
  combination for the safe. Time was running out quickly, and he was
  getting more and more anxious. Suddenly, with just 2 minutes remaining
  on the clock, an insight hit him. He entered a 4-digit number and the
  safe cracked open.</p>

<h2><a name="question6691"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/6691">Growing anagrams - What is the longest possible list forming a sentence?</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">51 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5840">BmyGuest#5840</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/7387">archaephyrryx#7387</a></p>

<p>This is a <em>challenge</em> for word-puzzle lovers. It might be a bit more of a game than a puzzle, but I think it is not limitless in it's answers, so a <em>final</em> answer could be found (eventually). </p>

<hr>

<h2>What is the longest list of <em>growing</em> anagrams which can be put into a grammatically correct English sentence?</h2>

<p><strong>Example for clarification:<br></strong>
Start with a word and then add words to the list with each having one <em>additional</em> letter to the one before. All letters may be re-arranged, i.e. all anagrams of the word are allowed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I</strong><br>
  <strong>in</strong> <br>
  <strong>pin</strong> ( or alternatively: <strong>nip</strong> ) <br>
  <strong>pain</strong> ( or alternatively: <strong>pian</strong> ) <br>
  <strong>paint</strong> (or alternatively: <strong>inapt</strong> )<br>
  ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may add <em>any</em> letter, but the list is only valid if you can then put <em>all</em> words of it into a single, English sentence which is grammatically correct. (It does not have to be very meaningful.) <br>
Such as in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>I paint "pin" in pain!</code> <br>
  ...says the painter while he is painting a shop-name ( "Pin &amp; Needle" ) onto the wall while having severe backache...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the aim is: **Find a single sentence using all (and only) the words of such a list, i.e. each word-length appears exactly once.</p>

<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Diacritics may be handled as "group" represented by their simplest form  <em>( a, ä, á... = a )</em> to allow for more flexibility in the solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>The shortest word of the list may have <em>any</em> length. (It does not have to be a single letter.) But the list has to contain a single word for each 'length' between the shortest and the longest word.</p></li>
<li><p>You may use arbitrary punctuation in the sentence. (Compound words count as single word.)</p></li>
<li><p>Names and acronyms are <em>allowed</em> but if used, give a reference for their validity. </p></li>
<li><p>If the meaning of the sentence is not apparently clear, give a little example of where it could be appear. (See example above.)</p></li>
<li><p>All words of the list have to appear exactly once in the sentence.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong><br>
This puzzle is about <em>English</em>, but if you can do the same in any other language and have a good example, please post here also. It will not be accepted as answer, though.</p>

<h2><a name="question16055"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/16055">Eccentric Millionaire Probability Paradox</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">51 votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/2722">Tyler Seacrest#2722</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/4479">JS1#4479</a></p>

<p>The following is a probability paradox I've been thinking about.  It involves <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayes' rule</a>;  if you're not familiar, a good starting example is a urn that has a 50% chance of containing one black ball and one white ball, and a 50% chance of having two black balls.  If you reach in at random and pull out a black ball, it becomes more likely there were two black balls to begin with.  Specifically, there is now a 1/3 chance of there being black and white balls in the urn, and a 2/3 chance of there being two black balls.</p>

<h3>The Setup</h3>

<p>Alice and her husband Bob are kidnapped by an eccentric millionaire that performs probability experiments on people.  Without them seeing the result, a coin is to be flipped.  </p>

<ul>
<li>If heads, one of the two of them (at random) will be brought to an office with a big red button that, if pushed, will transfer \$5000 to their joint bank account.  The other will be left in the holding cell.</li>
<li>If tails, both them them will be brought to separate offices with big red buttons, each with which removes \$2000 from their joint bank account.  </li>
</ul>

<p>They can discuss strategy ahead of time, but after the experiment starts they will be kept separate from each other.  What should they do?</p>

<h3>The Plan</h3>

<p>Alice and Bob reason their only two strategies are to push the button or not.  Not pushing the button is a net zero, and pushing the button yields an expected payoff of $1/2 \cdot (5000) + 1/2 \cdot(-4000) = 500$.  Not being particularly risk averse, they decide to go ahead and press the button.</p>

<h3>The Paradox</h3>

<p>The experiment starts, and Alice is summoned to an office with a big red button.  She is about to confidently press the button in accordance with their strategy, when she suddenly has second thoughts.  The fact that she has been brought to an office and not left in the holding cell gives her new information.  Using standard Bayes analysis, the probability the coin was heads is now $1/3$, and the probability the coin was tails is $2/3$.  Thus, now the expected value of their strategy is $1/3 \cdot ( 5000) + 2/3 \cdot (-4000) = -1000$.  </p>

<p>Suddenly, not pushing the button seems like a good strategy.  What's going on?  What should Alice do, which analysis was flawed, and what is wrong with the flawed analysis?  If it matters to your answer, assume Bob thinks in a very similar way to Alice, and would likely make the same decision as she would.</p>

<p>So my son is starting to show an interest in mathematics, and being the awesome dad that I am, I decided to buy him a basic calculator. Being the cheapskate that I am, I ordered the cheapest one I could find, which happened to be from <strong><em>NoSlaves™ Calculator Co.</em></strong> (<em>When only the cheapest calculator will do, make sure you buy from NoSlaves™, where we lovingly craft our calculators to almost adequate levels of quality, and totally don't use any slave labour... at all.</em>)</p>

<p>Unfortunately (and surprisingly), when it arrived, there seemed to be something wrong with it... I plugged in a few quick test calculations:</p>

<pre><code>1 + 1 = 1
4 + 3 = 9
8 - 3 + 5 = 6
24 + 51 = 84
50 - 74 + 39 = 98
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I like to complain as much as the next guy, so I went hunting through the instruction manual for the company's phone number. However, on the warranty and support information page, I found the following, scrawled in a strange, dark reddish, congealed ink of some sort:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2 - 3 + 4 = ?<br>
  80 - 17 = ?<br>
  4 - 1 + 2 - _ = ?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Curious, I entered in the calucluations... I didn't know what the underscore meant, so just ignored it, but regardless, the results were even more broken than my initial test calculations. By this stage I was bored, so I shrugged it off and went to bed.</p>

<p>Three weeks later, being the brilliant detective I am, I suddenly realised that the hand written message carried a cleverly concealed secret message. I immediately phoned the police department and was hailed as a hero.</p>

<p>(<em>Thanks to f'' for the help in chat! He solved the majority of this puzzle - I just came in at the end.</em>)</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Crossword</strong></p>

<p>The crossword was solved by feelinferrety, Z. Dailey, and Sleafar:</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Using The Key</strong></p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Step 4: Following Directions</strong></p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p>"In the verse / perfectly square" hints at the poems being more than just instructions. In fact, all of the text in the "article" is exactly 400 letters, which can be arranged into a 20×20 grid. "A pirate's search but in reverse" hints that we're starting at an X instead of ending at one. So, if you take the text and arrange it into a square grid, you get this:<br>

 Follow the directions in the third paragraph on the first grid (taking letters after every space), and you get the message "AMBIGRAM". If you repeat the process with the second grid and the second set of directions ("dual maps required, one fore one aft") you get "ISBROKEN".</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Step 5: The Image</strong></p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p>An ambigram is the same thing upside-down and right-side-up. The image is <em>almost</em> an ambigram, but some pixels are changed. If you XOR the image with itself rotated 180°, you get the following: <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0phTN.png"><img src="images/0phTN.png" alt="pleasewakeup"></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Step 6: Interpreting Everything</strong></p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p>Well, we appear to be in a coma. The messages on the borders of the "please wake up!" image are:<br>
 - We've been trying to get a message to you...<br>
 - You're in a coma...<br>
 - There was an accident...<br>
 - Open your eyes...<br>
 - We miss you...<br>
<br>
Even the crossword clues hint that you're in a coma: specifically, the unused clues for 7, 16, 21, and 26 across. (The solutions to those are "accident", "pity", "coma", and "dream".
<br>
 So we have two options: waking up and having to talk to people or staying in weird coma-land where everything is puzzles. I know which one <em>I'd</em> choose.</p>

<p>It is impossible.</p>

<p>Proof:<br>
Let the $7\times 28$ area be painted with black and white squares in a checkerboard pattern. Every piece will cover $2$ black and $2$ white squares, except the T-piece, which covers $3$ of one color and $1$ of another. Since there are $7$ T-pieces, a tiling that uses every piece cannot cover the same number of black and white squares. Since the board contains the same number of black and white squares, it is impossible.</p>

<p>After a period of thought, you approach the door triumphantly in order to type in</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> 2369</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as the keycode. </p>

<p>As you do so, you recall the reasoning that led you to this conclusion. Putting together the torn sticker, you saw a number of strange symbols in a gridlike shape. Fortunately for you, a calling card was left on the scene, describing the working mechanism of the locking machine. This struck you as a rather odd security practice, but you were not going to look a gift horse in the mouth.</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2RWir.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/2RWir.png" alt="fragment of ray diagram"></a><br>
 This indicates that some rays should be traced from some starting points, turning, splitting and stopping according to some rules. You wondered what these rules could be, and reached the conclusion that the strange symbols were surely involved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The grid had a number of those symbols, but after analyzing all of the available information, the meaning of each slowly became clear.</p>

<p>The easiest one to determine was #, thanks to the help of a previous unworthy puzzler who left his note on the floor. He might have failed in his mission, but you were sure you wouldn't do the same.</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LOALH.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/LOALH.png" alt="enter image description here"></a><br>
 The image indicates that a ray incident to the # symbol splits into 3 different rays, one in each direction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following that, you remembered another odd piece of paper you had found. > and &lt; didn't take long to fall.</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SuuBo.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/SuuBo.png" alt="enter image description here"></a><br>
 After tracing the paths between the numbers listed, you realize that the paths are perfectly described on the right if the symbols > and &lt; indicate right and left turns, respectively. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The writing on the wall seemed out of place. You thought maybe the placement of the @ symbol was important.</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XZXdA.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/XZXdA.png" alt="enter image description here"></a><br>
 If nothing goes through the @, then you reason it should be a ray blocker of some sort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The lowercase letters seemed impossible to crack. As a desperate attempt, you look through the peephole, when suddenly it opens to reveal someone looking back at you. Despite nearly dying of a heart attack, you manage to recall some very important schematics inside the room...</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dNLoL.gif" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/dNLoL.png" alt="enter image description here"></a><br>
 You notice that the colors in the drawing are blue, cyan, green, magenta, red and yellow, which have a 1-to-1 correspondence with the lowercase letters in the grid: bcgmry. The bottom picture, coupled with the fact that there are two of each of those letters in the grid, suggested those letters should act as portals, teleporting rays from one point of the grid to the other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you were clueless as to how any of this would precisely help you. Even if you figured out the inner workings of the system, how would that possibly help with getting in the door? You go back to the note on the ground...</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KPFGT.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/KPFGT.png" alt="enter image description here"></a><br>
 You thought this could mean there is an input-output relationship between the entered code and what the display shows. Thanks to your fiddling with the terminal earlier, you already knew another input-output pair right off the bat: 0001 = DONTGUESS. You recall an interesting line you saw earlier...<br>
 <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QUaQE.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/QUaQE.png" alt="enter image description here"></a><br>
  It would make a lot of sense if the display produced the word "ENIGMATIC" when the right sequence was pressed. You now noticed that all the letters necessary to spell ENTERPASSCODE, DONTGUESS and ENIGMATIC were present in the grid, so the words were likely being formed by some interaction between the rays and these letters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The numbers were still unaccounted for. But with your previous guesses, it only made sense that...</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> the numbers you typed into the machine were being used as starting points for the raycasting. But there were 4 spaces for numbers, so how could this relate to the points? Would that be related to this part of the note on the ground?<br>
 <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BrFhK.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/BrFhK.png" alt="enter image description here"></a><br>
 You remember the ramblings of your friend @f'' about combinatorics, and how those numbers represented the number of ways to pick 4 digits with order, 4 distinct digits with order, 4 digits without order and 4 distinct digits without order. You never thought any of that would ever be useful, yet here you are. This clued you to the fact that the order of the digits in the password does not matter: pressing the 0 button causes rays to be shot from all zeros in the grid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All pieces had nearly fallen into place. But you heard beforehand that most puzzlers that dared to open this door were thwarted by a single symbol. Surely enough, you only had a single symbol left: %, and it was proving to be quite the tricky beast. Maybe...</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LatfL.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/LatfL.png" alt="enter image description here"></a><br>
 The previous puzzler's notes suggest % is a line shy from being an X, which indicates blocking of some sort. In its initial state, % is open, but whenever one ray passes through this square, it becomes a blocker for further rays. In conclusion, if two or more rays hit this square, they are stopped on their tracks, but a single ray should be able to make it out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, all of it was purely conjecture. But remembering you had two output pairs, did they confirm your theories? You had to test it to find out.</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> What happens when rays from all zeros are cast?<br>
<br>
 <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DLZeE.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/DLZeE.png" alt="enter image description here"></a><br>
<br>
 You read the uppercase letters crossed by the rays from top to bottom, left to right: "ENTERPASSCODE". You must be on to something! The next step is to try it out with 0001:<br>
<br>
 <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1EoOH.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/1EoOH.png" alt="enter image description here"></a><br>
<br>
  You noticed the pink square is a paradox, because letting a ray through it would allow it to loop around to the pink square, blocking itself. You then assumed whoever engineered the system dealt with this somehow, possibly by blocking the ray outright. Making that assumption, the uppercase letters form "DONTGUESS"! Couldn't be a coincidence, could it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All that was left was figuring out the combination to open the door. By using some process of elimination to quickly weed out numbers that couldn't be present in the final passcode, you reached your most likely candidate.</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> Most of the numbers caused the rays to immediately pass through letters not in ENIGMATIC. In fact, the only 4 numbers you saw that did not were 2,3,6 and 9. What happens when you use these 4 as starting points?<br>
<br>
  <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HuKhr.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/HuKhr.png" alt="enter image description here"></a>
<br>
  You read the crossed letters: ENIGMATIC! </p>

In this case B must be thinking, that he may not have blue eyes either, and B is looking at C and D, whom he perceives as being the only ones to have blue eyes (since I consider the option that I don't have blue eyes), and B thinks that C is having the same reasoning. C thinks he does not have blue eyes and only D has.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, the issue here is that I, being A, can see that B has blue eyes. Therefore I know that C sees at least D and B as having blue eyes. But this is the reasoning of B, who does not know that he has blue eyes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I project myself into the reasoning of the next person, I cannot use the knowledge I have of their eyes color.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same goes for 5 people and more. I see 4 blue eyed people, each of which is possibly seeing only 3, and thinking that each of the other is possibly seeing only 2...</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I wanted to confirm my suspicions, so I snuck into Wordberg's lab with a modified X-ray device, and I was able to verify via video that my descriptions below are indeed correct.  I was only able to capture video of one of the words Alconja tried, but here it is:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0sog.gif"><img src="images/f0sog.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Looks like this very cool machine has a bunch of components wonderfully hinted at in the illustration.</p>

<p>It seems that first the input word is</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>split into two parts</strong> with one part following the left path and one following the right path.  There is some ambiguity in which half goes to which path.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The left path</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> is an <strong>antonym machine</strong>, represented by the full change in color from a dark red to a light red.  The antonym is then stored at the bottom of the left path until the word on the right path is complete.  When the final right-side product is ready, the left-side antonym is <strong>flipped and stamped in the middle</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The right path</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> has four components.  The first component (light blue) <strong>rotates a single letter</strong>.  The second component—the green box with pistons—<strong>picks up one letter and moves it elsewhere</strong>.  The third component (red plus sign) <strong>increments the value of the first remaining letter by one</strong>.  And the fourth component (the final blue-bracketed component before it drops the word into the bin) <strong>stretches the remaining letters out</strong> to allow the antonym stamping in the middle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the first pair of words is</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>smallscale</strong> and <strong>tangible</strong>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>because  </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>smallscale</strong> is split into "<strong>small</strong>" and "<strong>scale</strong>"<br>
 The "<strong>small</strong>" goes down the left path and is converted to "<strong>big</strong>".<br>
 The "<strong>scale</strong>" goes down the right path and the "<strong>c</strong>" is rotated 90° to become an "<strong>n</strong>", leaving "<strong>snale</strong>".<br>
 One letter of "<strong>snale</strong>" is moved to a new position, leaving "<strong>sanle</strong>".<br>
 The "<strong>s</strong>" is incremented to become "<strong>t</strong>", leaving "<strong>tanle</strong>".<br>
 "<strong>tanle</strong>" is stretched to "<strong>tan---le</strong>" and <strong>big</strong> is reverse-stamped into it to make <strong>tangible</strong>.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the second pair is</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>nosier</strong> and <strong>jerseys</strong>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>because  </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>nosier</strong> is split into "<strong>no</strong>" and "<strong>sier</strong>"<br>
 The "<strong>no</strong>" goes down the left path and is converted to "<strong>yes</strong>".<br>
 The "<strong>sier</strong>" goes down the right path where the "<strong>s</strong>" is rotated 180°, leaving "<strong>sier</strong>".<br>
 The "<strong>s</strong>" from "<strong>sier</strong>" is moved to the end, leaving "<strong>iers</strong>".<br>
 The "<strong>i</strong>" is incremented to "<strong>j</strong>" leaving "<strong>jers</strong>".
 "<strong>jers</strong>" is stretched to "<strong>jer---s</strong>" and <strong>yes</strong> is reverse-stamped into it to make <strong>jerseys</strong>.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the third pair being</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>apron</strong> and <strong>afford</strong>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>because  </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>apron</strong> is split into "<strong>apr</strong>" and "<strong>on</strong>"<br>
 The "<strong>on</strong>" goes down the left path and is converted to "<strong>off</strong>".<br>
 The "<strong>apr</strong>" goes down the right path and the "<strong>p</strong>" is rotated 180° to become a "<strong>d</strong>" leaving "<strong>adr</strong>".<br>
 One letter is moved from "<strong>adr</strong>" to give us "<strong>ard</strong>".<br>
 <strong>The incrementing component malfunctions and no letters are incremented!</strong>  As Guntram Blohm pointed out, this can be seen in the animation during the "apron" sequence.<br>
 "<strong>ard</strong>" is stretched to "<strong>a---rd</strong>" and <strong>off</strong> is reverse-stamped into it to make <strong>afford</strong>.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the fourth pair is</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>outputs</strong> and <strong>unpins</strong>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>because  </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>outputs</strong> is split into "<strong>out</strong>" and "<strong>puts</strong>"<br>
 The "<strong>out</strong>" goes down the left path and is converted to "<strong>in</strong>".<br>
 The "<strong>puts</strong>" goes down the right path and the "<strong>u</strong>" is rotated 180° to become an "<strong>n</strong>", leaving "<strong>pnts</strong>".<br>
 The "<strong>t</strong>" from "<strong>pnts</strong>" is moved leaving "<strong>tpns</strong>".<br>
 The "<strong>t</strong>" is incremented to become "<strong>u</strong>", giving us "<strong>upns</strong>".<br>
 "<strong>upns</strong>" is stretched to "u-p-ns" and <strong>in</strong> is reverse-stamped into the blank spaces to make <strong>unpins</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If all that's true, then the tile we need to replace is</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>inputs</strong> (since "tangible" is the other broken one and we generated that)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which we could do by entering</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>shutdown</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>because</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> "<strong>shutdown</strong>" will be split into "<strong>shut</strong>" and "<strong>down</strong>"
 The "<strong>down</strong>" goes down the left path and is converted to "<strong>up</strong>".<br>
 The "<strong>shut</strong>" goes down the right path and the "<strong>u</strong>" is rotated to become an "<strong>n</strong>", leaving "<strong>shnt</strong>".<br>
 The "<strong>s</strong>" from "<strong>shnt</strong>" is moved leaving "<strong>hnts</strong>".<br>
 The "<strong>h</strong>" is incremented to become "<strong>i</strong>", giving us "<strong>ints</strong>".<br>
 "<strong>ints</strong>" is stretched to "<strong>in--ts</strong>" and <strong>up</strong> is reverse-stamped into it to make <strong>inputs</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this leads me to conclude that when Alconja gets around to making a word machine, it'll far outperform Professor Wordberg's and restore Alconja's place in the Verba Retorta hierarchy!</p>

<h2><a name="solution24848"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/24848">How can 64 = 65?</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">109 Votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/435">ʇolɐǝz ǝɥʇ qoq#435</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/15942">Dr Xorile#15942</a></p>

<p>This is a famous physical puzzle that can be tied to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">fibonacci series</a>.</p>

<p>To answer the question as posed, the issue is that the two slopes are different ($\frac25$ vs $\frac38$).  Note that all those numbers are in the fibonacci series ($1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,\ldots$).</p>

<p>Successive fractions are closer approximations to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">$\varphi$</a>, alternating between above and below.  Diagrams like this can be generated by making a square with sides equal to a number in the fibonacci series (in this question 8), then dividing it into two rectangles with widths of the two fibonacci numbers that make up the first one chosen (3 and 5).</p>

<p>Cut the smaller one down the diagonal, and cut the bigger one down the middle at a diagonal, such that the width of the diagonal cut is the next smallest number (2 in this case).  Note that this will leave a trapezoid, whose small parallel size matches the original small rectangle's smaller side (3 in this case), and whose larger parallel size matches the original larger rectangle's smaller side (5 in this case).</p>

<p>Since $\frac25\approx\frac38$, and from the above constructions, the pieces can be rearranged into a rectangle (as shown), the area of which will always be one away from the original square, but will look approximately correct, since the slopes almost match.</p>

<p>Edit: Since this answer received so many up-votes (thank you!), I suppose people are very interested in it, so I thought I'd draw up a few images!</p>

<p>If you leave home with 2 cakes, you will never pay the troll toll. You give him half of your cakes (one) and he gives one cake back to you. </p>

<p>So the answer is <strong><em>2</em></strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h3>The exact solution :</h3>

<p>Assume we have $x$ cakes, </p>

<ul>
<li>after the 1<sup>st</sup> bridge, we have $\frac{x}{2}+1 = \frac{x+2}{2}$ cakes</li>
<li>after the 2<sup>nd</sup> bridge, we have $\dfrac{\frac{x+2}{2}+2}{2} = \dfrac{x+2+4}{4}$ cakes</li>
<li>after the 3<sup>rd</sup> bridge, we have $\dfrac{\frac{x+2+4}{4}+2}{2} = \dfrac{x+2+4+8}{8}$ cakes</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>after the n<sup>th</sup> bridge, we have $\frac{x+2+4+\dots+2^n}{2^n}$ cakes</li>
<li>So, after the last bridge ($n=7$), we have $\frac{x+2+4+8+16+32+64+128}{128} = \frac{x+254}{128}$ cakes</li>
</ul>

<p>According to the puzzle, we have 2 cakes at the end, </p>

<p>$$
\frac{x+254}{128} = 2 \\

<p><sup><em>For full meta effect, I should beat Deusovi to the answer before he sees this puzzle ...</em> <code>:-&gt;</code></sup></p>

<p>$\def\G #1{\color{lime}{\text{#1}}}$
$\def\R #1{\color{red}{\text{#1}}}$
$\def\B #1{\color{blue}{\text{#1}}}$</p>

<p>This puzzle can actually be analysed quite rigorously ...</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/guNAj.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/guNAj.png" alt="annotated image"></a></p>

<p>Let $A_n,B_n,C_n,X_n,Y_n,Z_n$ be the six entrances/exits to the $n$th largest triangle. Thus, in this image, the labelled gaps are $A_1,X_1$, etc. and the gaps on the green triangle are $A_2,X_2$, etc. Because the maze is fractal, $n$ can range from 1 to infinity.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>$\G{Entering}$ $\G{the}$ $\G{$n$th}$ $\G{largest}$ $\G{triangle}$ $\G{at}$ $\G{$B_n$}$ $\G{or}$ $\G{$C_n$}$ is equivalent, since the two are connected by the maze. Via the small teleport circles, they're also $\R{connected}$ $\R{to}$ $\R{$A_n$}$ $\R{and}$ $\R{$X_{n+1}$}$ $\R{and}$ $\R{$Z_{n+1}$}$, $\B{and}$ $\B{to}$ $\B{$Y_{n+1}$}$. Via the large teleport circles within the $(n+1)$th largest triangle, they're also connected to $\R{$X_{n+1}$}$ $\R{and}$ $\R{$Y_{n+1}$}$, $\G{$Z_{n+1}$}$ $\G{and}$ $\G{$C_{n+2}$}$, and $\B{$A_{n+2}$}$ and $\B{$B_{n+2}$}$ (see second image below - note that both images can be clicked for full-size versions).</p>

<li><p>$\R{Entering}$ $\R{the}$ $\R{$n$th}$ $\R{largest}$ $\R{triangle}$ $\R{at}$ $\R{$X_n$}$ $\R{or}$ $\R{$Y_n$}$ is equivalent, since the two are connected by the maze.

</ul>

<p>Summarising: we can get from the $A,B,C$ entrances in one triangle to the $X,Y,Z$ ones in the next smallest triangle, and vice versa. Deusovi starts off with access to $A_1,B_1,C_1$, so he can reach the entrances/exits $A_{2n+1},B_{2n+1},C_{2n+1}$ and $X_{2n},Y_{2n},Z_{2n}$ for all $n$, but - crucially - he <em>cannot</em> reach $X_1,Y_1,Z_1$. So your design is excellent and he is doomed to wander forever. Have an upvote!</p>

<p class="subtitle">80 Votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5208">Alconja#5208</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5208">Alconja#5208</a></p>

<h2>Complete Solution from OP</h2>

<p>Well, my Uncle would be proud... It was a team effort, but ultimately it was <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/15063/5208">rand al'thor who eluded the pirate's curse and found the treasure</a>!</p>

<p>Although rand's answer is ultimately correct and he has been awarded his bounty, I'm posting/accepting this answer to provide a canonical solution and to recognise the contributions made by various people throughout the search.</p>

<hr>

<p>The first challenge is to determine which way North is on the map (<a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/15063/5208">first identified correctly by rand al'thor</a>). This is achieved by observing that the blotches around the compass rose are formed by the holes in the capital letters of the words NORTH, SOUTH, EAST and WEST, as shown here:</p>

<p><img src="images/kGipH.png" alt="compass rose"></p>

<p>So once rotated, the map, as used for the rest of the challenge, will look like this (with points discussed below marked):</p>

<p><img src="images/GzXZB.png" alt="solved map"></p>

<p>From here, the riddle can be attacked...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Start your search from dead man's cave and follow the clues herein.<br>
  Sharpen a sword and your wits and you're ready to begin.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's 6 initial possibilities for "dead man's cave", but we haven't yet got enough information to work out which it is yet... we'll come back to it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paired up, pared down, the truth exposed, lies within lies.<br>
  Heading onwards north, reeling seas terrorize.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This stanza involves word play, which when deciphered provides a clear directive (and was again <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/14985/5208">cracked first by rand al'thor</a>). To clarify the ambiguous wording, it could have been written as <em>"Paired up, [and then] pared down, the truth [will be] exposed, [as it] lies within [the following] lies: 'Heading onwards north reeling seas terrorize'"</em>. With the apparent instruction to head north towards/away from the sea identified as a lie, we can "pair up" the words in the second line to get <em>"headingonwards northreeling seasterrorize"</em>, then we pare these down to produce <em>"[headin]<strong>go</strong>[nwards] [nor]<strong>three</strong>[ling] [s]<strong>east</strong>[errorize]"</em>, and we've exposed the truth: <strong>go three east</strong>. Although this helps us rule out two starting caves (since we can't go off the edge of the map), we still don't know where to go east from, so we'll look at the next stanza.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Right is left and left is right, turn and go until,<br>
  Twins appear to mark an end, though you'll continue still.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first line is simple (and was solved independently several times): You need to turn, such that what's currently on your "right is left [behind]", meaning that "left is [the] right [way to turn]", then start travelling forward (i.e. North)... The "twins" refer to multiple duplicated squares within the map itself: <code>SK</code>-<code>II</code>, <code>IH</code>-<code>AC</code>, <code>NE</code>-<code>IP</code> and <code>LP</code>-<code>NQ</code>, which when joined, as shown in orange on the map, produce <strong>X</strong> marks (i.e. X marks the spot... how else would a pirate mark an end?). Note that at this point we can narrow the possibilities of which cave to start at down to either <code>TH</code> or <code>AE</code>, as indicated by the two possible paths on the map (this stanza was ultimately <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/15079/5208">solved by Zandar</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cardinals sitting in their nests, pick them up one by one.<br>
  Set them free and follow them, then turn to what's undone.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This stanza is pure letter play and relies in finding the <em>cardinal directions</em> in <em>"th<strong>e</strong>ir <strong>nes</strong>t<strong>s</strong>"</em>, giving you a set of directions: <strong>E N E S S</strong>. After following those, you need to <em>turn</em> and face the only direction not yet travelled, so we end this stanza facing West (<a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/14718/5208">tfitzger was first to post a complete solution</a> to this, though <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/14880/5208">Daniel K, solved 99% of it independently too</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A leap of faith, surrender yourself. But when things come to a head,<br>
  Take the easy way out, with the blues left behind, go three and don't retread.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From here, we take a "leap of faith" into the river and go with the flow until we reach the "headland". Exit the river onto the beach (the easy way) and with the blue river/sea tiles to our "left" and "behind", we go three more squares forward. As <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/15079/5208">observed by Zandar</a>, we can now narrow our path down to a single possibility, since starting from the cave at <code>AE</code> would result in us "retreading" during this stanza, which we're explicitly told not to do. So we now know for certain that dead man's cave is at <code>TH</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Follow the gaze of the crimson saint as he looks to the pre-dawn glow.<br>
  The distance the crow flies in to pi, hints how far to go.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/15079/5208">Zandar again correctly observed</a>, the crimson saint refers to Santa Claus, who lives at the North pole meaning he'll be looking South no matter what he's looking towards. The distance the crow flies involves a little Pythagorus' Theorem applied to the coordinates <code>IN</code> and <code>PI</code>, which being 4 rows and 3 columns apart gives us exactly 5. So we head <strong>5 South</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two one fives, all lined up, this time point the way.<br>
  They also indicate how far. Go now or be led astray.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/15168/5208">User1618143 correctly observed</a> that "two one fives" here tells us that "the time" of 15:15 "points the way". Looking at the hands of a clock, which "line up" at this time to both point in an Easterly direction towards the number 3, meaning we head 3 East. We need to "go now or be led astray", because if we don't the time will change and the clock hands will point in the wrong direction.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Proceed until, when viewed from on high, the island itself gives a sign.<br>
  Next steps revealed as the river reflects and the ancient stones align.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Proceeding from where we are at this point, the only way to get somewhere "high", is to travel due North until climbing the edge of the mountain at <code>YH</code>. From here we can see the "ancient stones" on the ground near the river. Again, <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/15168/5208">user1618143 showed</a> that if we "reflect" the existing stones, using the "river" as an axis, we end up with a series of arrows, such that connecting them spells out <strong>3E</strong>, as shown on the map in pink. This tells us that we need to travel 3 East from this point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Run forth with what you carry. Confusion becomes clear.<br>
  Now piece together your reward, you'll find it buried here.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The final stanza is a two parter. <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/15063/5208">Rand al'thor correctly realised</a> that "confusion becomes clear" hinted towards anagrams for both the final directive and the treasure itself. First we needed to "Run forth" with what we carry, which, as we learned from the very first stanza, is "a sword". And <em>"run forth a sword"</em> is an anagram for <em>"four northwards"</em>, so we go four North from here to find the final location of the treasure at <code>NR</code>.</p>

<p>Now to discover the treasure itself, we "piece together" the coordinates that we arrived at for each stanza: <code>TH TD OD NE BE UE UH YR NR</code> which is an anagram for "<strong>Three Hundred Bounty</strong>", which was again <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/15063/5208">discovered, and subsequently awarded to, rand al'thor</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Be warned though treasure seeker, should you make but one wrong turn.<br>
  The pirate's curse, and certain death, is all that you will earn...  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so our treasure hunt comes to an end, and we pause to remember those that fell along the way... and to congratulate rand al'thor on his ultimate victory.</p>

<p>Ok, an excellent puzzle like this deserves a complete answer, so I'm going to bring everything together and fill in the missing blanks...</p>

<hr>

<p>First, we have to determine if there's actually a reason to look for Karen and the kids, so:</p>

<p><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/30527">WorldSEnder noticed that </a>in the text there are multiple unicode characters used as substitute for normal letters. If you take each of the words that contains a unicode character you can find:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">

<p>The next thing to note is that the text below the photo, <code>2p:4a;4d;43</code>, points us to:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> the 2nd paragraph of text, and within it words 74, 77 and 67, giving us: "<strong>least significant bit</strong>"</p>

<p>From here, we can <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/30579">follow 2012campion's lead</a> and take the photo and:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> extract the least significant bits from the RGB components of each pixel. Then we convert each 8 bits into ascii characters (taking the least significant bit first), to produce the text:<br>
<br>
 <code>Mnp, M uawn'g oynyi pgn. Wr'yy ohie cbdadjchh! Jgfebqy jdw nsbtvqa nw lfex wuhh gki baws nqx V jsk laeeh uag hiszgrg of ryk.

</blockquote>

<p>Now, as <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/30527">WorldSEnder notes</a>, the original email has:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> Several unicode characters replacing their standard ascii representations, extracting these spells out: "<strong>Helps us figure out the clue key is understand</strong>"<br>
<br>
 This gives us the key for the Vigenère ciphered text above, producing:<br>
<br>
 <code>Sam, I didn't leave you. We've been kidnapped! Someone was waiting at home when the kids and I got there and dragged us out. They gave me a computer to write you an email, so you wouldn't look for me, but got distracted by the kids for a moment. I'm leaving you this message so you can let Jason know where to find us. They're keeping us at 3746 Landon St - the old abandoned hotel near main street. We're in some kind of underground bunker, but there's only three of them. They are armed, so make sure that he comes ready. I look forward to seeing you again. Love you, Karen P.S.

</blockquote>

<p>Taking this message, and the "filename" mentioned in the email (106t154iq20rig62yyuj91atnfl173vecbof29gfjyqcn98), we can work out who has taken Karen.</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> If we look at the original email, and <em>start from "I"</em> (i.e the first paragraph, ignoring "Dear Sam"), <em>ignore the first seven</em> strings included in the filename and just take characters: 106, 154, 20, 62, 91, 173, 29 and 98, we spell out: <strong>Itiskyle</strong>.

<p>Wait... I recognise that name...</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> Looking back at the original email trail, we see Jason mention that "<em>[Karen] didn't come in to work, this morning, either, but neither did Kyle, Jim, or the rest of my team</em>". Looks like Jason's team has gone rogue and, led by Kyle, has taken Karen hostage.  </p>

<p class="subtitle">75 Votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/11297">Bob#11297</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/10281">leoll2#10281</a></p>

<p><em>Question:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does <strong>everybody</strong> want a drink?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The third logician answers:  </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> "<strong>YES</strong>" if he wants a drink, "<strong>NO</strong>" if doesn't want it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Reason:</em> </p>

<p>The first says "I don't know" because he wants a drink, but doesn't know if  everybody wants one. If the first didn't want a drink, he would have answered "No".<br>
 Same for the second, he wants a drink but doesn't know if the third wants one.
 So, the third answers "Yes" if he wants a drink, "No" if he doesn't.</p>

<p><hr>
We need to be able to split it into 9 parts of 56, so it can't hurt to make 9 pieces of 56 and then split those further. Since we need to do better than 19 pieces, we can have at most 18 pieces. This means that most of our 56s are split into exactly two parts (we can have an extra piece for every 56 we don't split).</p>

<p>Now, what will our pieces be mod 9? We must be able to group them into 7 or 8 groups that sum to 0, or make 9 pairs (mostly) that sum to 2. If we have a 2, we can group it with a 7 to make 0. Then we pair the 7 with a 4, and repeat with a 5 and 6. If we do this 3 times, we can use the 6s to make another 0.</p>

<p>To make 63s and 72s, we should repeat at an interval of 9, so that we can swap the pairs to add 9 (e.g. <code>{7,56} {16,47} {25,38} -&gt; {16,56} {25,47}</code>). The other two numbers that are swapped out need an extra 27.</p>

<p>Suppose we start with a <code>56</code> (freeing up one cut) and see what numbers we need.</p>

<pre>    56-> 7->49->14->42
 9->47->16->40->23->33
18->38->25->31->32->24</pre>

<p>So far, this makes 6 63s with <code>9 18 24 33 42</code> left over. We also need to make a 27 and a 72 out of <code>24 33 42</code>. If we split <code>33</code> into <code>3</code> and <code>30</code>, both of these are resolved. This results in the final answer with 18 pieces.</p>

<h2><a name="solution43276"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/43276">REJBÄS - an unfinished flat-pack puzzle</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">71 Votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5208">Alconja#5208</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/18250">Beastly Gerbil#18250</a></p>

<h2>Side note:</h2>

<p>I have made a <a href="https://tinkercad.com/things/4S6ABYgmo3E" rel="noreferrer">cube of the first net in a 3D viewer</a>. I advise clicking on 'view in 3D'.<br><br> This may be helpful in Step 1...</p>

<hr>

<p>To start with, the top tells us we need to use a thin pen and not a thick one, and a paint fill tool. </p>

<p>It appears that Alconja couldn't understand the instructions so instead posted it here in hope of rep...</p>

<p><strong>STEP 1</strong></p>

<p>(@graaaarg solved most of this)</p>

<p>Well it seems we need to look on the packaging to find out what cubes there are. However Alconja thoughtlessly threw away the packaging:</p>

<p><em>'I already opened the puzzle, and discarded the packaging'</em></p>

<p>So it looks like we have to deduce which cubes are the correct ones.</p>

<p>It <strong><em>can't</em></strong> be the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1.</strong> because the orientation of the black V relative to the grey triangle doesn't match the corresponding 3-piece.</li>
<li><strong>4.</strong> because the grey side would need to be opposite of the black diagonal after assembling the 6-piece.</li>
<li><strong>5.</strong> because when the grey hexagon and the black right angle are adjacent as pictured, the top of the cube would be the grey circle.</li>
<li><strong>6.</strong> because the orientation of the black diagonal relative to the gray square doesn't match the 6-piece.</li>
</ul>

<p>So it can only be RS-02 or RS-03.</p>

<p><strong>BOTH</strong> are viable, so one will be ruled out later...</p>

<p><strong>STEP 2</strong></p>

<p>Once we have the two cubes we appear to need to place them on the grid...</p>

<p>The top face of the left cube goes in the top left corner as demonstrated by the diagram and the top face of the right hand cube goes in the bottom left corner.</p>

<p><strong>This rules out RS-02</strong> as the 6 piece is on the right and hence wouldn't fit. So we need to fit in RS-03</p>

<p><em>However</em> we also need to follow the rule below:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kwv9I.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/kwv9I.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>The lock appears to be on one of the 3 piece components: </p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xTYiK.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/xTYiK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>And the key is on one of the tiles:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A0oFM.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/A0oFM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>So when the cubes go on the tiles then the piece with the lock needs to go on like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yEIVo.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/yEIVo.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>And if we rub a bit out we can see:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qgYPL.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/qgYPL.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>The key going into the lock exactly like the instructions say:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KWGR0.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/KWGR0.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>So the 6 piece has to go on as following:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rU5No.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/rU5No.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>But then this doesn't make sense regarding the lock and key...</p>

<p>So what if this was a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle" rel="noreferrer">Sliding Puzzle</a></strong>?</p>

<p>The puzzle never tells us to fill in every square...</p>

<p>So the tiles should go on like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/64i6x.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/64i6x.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>This would then make sense for the instructions in <strong>Step 4</strong></p>

<p><strong>STEP 3</strong></p>

<p>All drawing instructions (steps 3 &amp; 5) connect various dots together via lines. Importantly, they use shapes to represent the tile in question and other hints to indicate which dots need connecting, so:</p>

<p>In the first step, we draw from the dot marked "A" in the semi-circle tile, to the dot marked "D" in the hexagon tile. The second step shows that we have to connect the two triangle tiles using the dots in their centres.</p>

<p>This is what we get:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3F8dX.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/3F8dX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p><strong>STEP 4</strong></p>

<p>As mentioned above, the arrows are the directions we have to slide tiles into the empty space.</p>

<p>The 4th arrow is interpreted as slide right and rotate 270 degrees</p>

<p>@BmyGuest kindly supplied a visual walkthrough of each row:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VpuRG.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/VpuRG.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sCwaU.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/sCwaU.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Note that the penultimate step was missed by accident</p>

<p>So we end up with this:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gsjUq.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/gsjUq.jpg" alt=" "></a></p>

<p><strong>STEP 5</strong></p>

<p>As with step 3, we have two lines to draw. The first runs from the lone dot marked with an "E" (on the filled triangle tile), through the centre of the tile represented by the hollow diamond, and continuing off the edge (note that there is no dot at the end of the dashed line).</p>

<p>The second line shows a line drawn between two large shapes. These shapes are the top quadrants of an asterisk and a solid diamond, indicating we should draw a line from the top dot between these tiles and their shared centre dot.  </p>

<p>At this point, the puzzle looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v9C7m.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/v9C7m.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a><br>
<em>(note that this image shows a line incorrectly drawn on the left side of the "<strong>*</strong>" tile, when it should actually appear along the bottom edge due to the rotation that occurred during step 4)</em></p>

<p><strong>STEP 6</strong></p>

<p>These are also sliding instructions, showing the movement of the "hole"...</p>

<p><strong>STEP 7</strong></p>

<p>After rotating in step 6 we have to fill the area surrounding the asterisk, bounded by any drawn lines, with grey:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zQ0Nw.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/zQ0Nw.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p><strong>STEP 8</strong></p>

<p>This is a rebus (solved mostly by @WesleySitu and @Deusovi)</p>

<p>It shows 'wrote eight', 'back' and 'won third' which is:</p>

<p><strong>Rotate back one third</strong></p>

<p>There has only been one previously rotated tile so we have to rotate that back by 1/3 of what it was originally rotated (i.e back 1/4 of a revolution).</p>

<p><strong>STEP 9</strong></p>

<p>@ffao showed some brilliant thinking to solve this.</p>

<p>All the numbers are 1 to 12, and the dot represents 9 (or more specifically the hole where the 9 tile would be if there was one). We can order this as such:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>3  4  11 8
1  5  .  2
10 12 6  7</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>So if we reorder tiles to (again, with the gap in the 9 slot):</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8
9  10 11 12</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="solution18782"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/18782">A good puzzle is a double-edged sword</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">70 Votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/4852">Richard#4852</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/15757">moonbutt74#15757</a></p>

<p><strong>Section One</strong></p>

<p>I started by researching futhark, Germanic/Teutonic, Anglo-saxon runes. I don't interpret the characters too tightly as "modern" letters. (<strong>Note:</strong> These are <strong>stylised</strong> characters, bull past the flair to "see" them.)</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_cross_variants">crosses</a></strong> <strong>ARE</strong> Greek as suggested by a few commentators in the <a href="http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2015/08/help-us-decipher-this-inscription.html">article</a> linked to in OP. I don't see how the crossbars at the tips could make it mistakeable for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltese_cross">maltese cross</a>, which debunks the argument for an Islamic origin. My reasoning being the level of craft involved in the rest of the inscription suggests that had the artisan intended to inscribe a maltese cross, he would have done so properly.</p>

<p>Another commentator high-signing PhD cred suggests the crosses in opening and closing to be the wrapper on the benediction,
<strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnrG904talA">In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, Amen</a></strong>, which would make them characters as well.</p>

<p>If I'm on the right track the first few characters seem to be more like <code>HDGOG</code>, I might be off on the <code>O</code>, I think the tenth character may be a <code>U</code>.
The mystery character <code>R #11</code> may be a "lowercase" <code>N</code>, which would make sense in that the name/title of Christ is still subordinate to the name God.</p>

<p>Now, runes are also <strong>still</strong> believed to possess magic properties, it's likely that this inscription may be a name for the blade, a prayer, or a "spell". Runes, besides being the regular writing of the people/tribes who regularly used them, were also viewed as mystical/magical by those from other tribes/groups. So I think that's a good place to start.</p>

<p>Beowulf would be a good primer, <a href="http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/jo/nordic/runes4.htm">Beware Grendel...</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Runes [many] also represent individual words, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_alphabet">Gothic runes.</a></p>

<p>It's thought that a mixed cipher kind of thing might be going on here between the meaning of individual characters and some peppering with Latin maybe? </p>

<p>There is some suggestion the <code>X</code> character is a separator, otherwise the first letter of the name/title of Christ. <code>X = C</code></p>

<p>Now, here is my first bit of guessing based on the rune theory, the first two letters from the Gothic Rune chart (linked above)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naudiz"> N "naudiz" or "nyd" or "nauor" </a> can mean roughly
  <code>need, constraint, duress, trouble</code></p>
  
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagaz"> D "dagaz" or "daeg" </a> means <code>day</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Going back to the suggestion of the cipher/Latin peppering-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>N irae $\rightarrow$ <code>ire, anger, wrath, trouble</code></p>
  
  <p>D dies $\rightarrow$ <code>day</code></p>
  
  <p>dies irae $\rightarrow$ <code>day of wrath</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not the craziest theory, but we are talking about a sword here. An incantation/inscription evoking the spirit/magic of death is not unreasonable. Those are rough translations of what those characters actually mean in runic context.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://annales.info/evrope/drboglav/t07.htm">this page</a> for a listing of "known" translations of similar inscriptions.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Section 2:</strong> </p>

<p><strong>This section will be for manipulations of the "translations".</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Word of the Dei... xD , sorry,
  <a href="http://www.britannica.com/topic/homoousios">[H]omoousios</a> homoousios
  (Greek: “of one substance”) The XCH of the inscriptio has me reaching, > true, but i think i am following the right track but don't quote me on quod ! xD</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The <em>n</em> character in oranipotentis seems to function as a connector with no other value. I wonder if it works like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bind_rune">bindrune</a> ?</p>

<p>An interesting note on both the bindrune thought and some [further] Greek connections come by way of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_Rho">chi-rho</a> symbol, see the spelling Xpisti below, which looks a little odd. ?</p>

<pre><code>Settled so far...?
ORVI = ORUI the "u" serve the same function here.
Another example: sigillum = sigillvm == seal
So, ORVI, ORUI =

[O]mnipotentis, [R]edemptoris [U]niversorum [I]esu
Almighty God, the Redeemer of all Jesus

Xpisti = Christ, then what is C? Which again skews my results
below but, it's still neat how that turned out.

After playing for a bit I think this may be similar
to a variation of the Greek word for appeal,
so,

[X]pisti [C]hristi [H]omoousios

Doing a run from Latin &gt;&gt; Greek,

Xpisti Christi Homoousios &gt;&gt; Επίκληση Χριστός ομοούσιος
Phonetically --------------&gt; Epíkli̱si̱ Christós omooúsios

then Greek to English

Επίκληση Χριστός ομοούσιος &gt;&gt; Invoking Christ consubstantial
</code></pre>

<p>I will temporarily add this idea to my translation in progress but i am not settled on it. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consubstantiality">consubstantiality</a> .</p>

<p>I think the "W" could be attributed to illiteracy or the error that comes with repetition. The "lowercase" is probably what i thought it to be.</p>

<p>I'm still puzzling out particulars, there are letter "substitutions" and so, "alternate" spellings to sort through.</p>

<p><strong>Final Guess.</strong></p>

<p>Based on the suggestion by commentator <a href="http://profile.typepad.com/6p01b8d1456bae970c">Philip Seddon</a> ,
The latter "H" characters may be seen as indicators of a <em>feminine</em> denominator, meaning N = H as covered
earlier in my answer on the subject of runic characters interchangeability/similarity/substitution etc..</p>

<p>Also, the subject of the misidentified "R" being a "lowercase" n and, the "C" later "G" actually being
"G" later "C", AND, on my almost certainty that "X" is not a "placeholder/seperator" but an alternate "C"
and lastly the "W" being downside-up "M", although I believe a double "U"
e.g. "VV" could be just as like but, I couldn't see/find a fit.</p>

<pre><code>+NDXOXGHMDnCHDXORVI+

+&lt;
In Nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, Amen,

N      D      X       O
Nomine Domini Christi omnipotentis, 

X       G          H      M      D      n      C

&gt;+
In Nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, Amen,
</code></pre>

<p><strong>So,</strong></p>

<pre><code>Nomine Domini Christi omnipotentis, 
Christi genitricis Nomine Matris Domini nostri Christi,
Nomine Domini Christi omnipotentis redemptoris universorum Iesu


the name of our Lord Jesus Christ Almighty,
the name of the Mother of Christ, Mother of our Lord Christ,
the name of Jesus Christ Almighty Redeemer of all

<p>I'm still not satisfied with my answer and have clearly hit my limit of skill with this. I hope that by turning what i have so far over to Community Wiki [and a penalty free format] will attract some more users willing to jump in. It's a neat mystery and I want to know what the inscription actually is.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>To find this, I first noted that each of the blanks must be at least 8, since there are already 8 digits different from the given one. None of the blanks can be 8, though, since that would mean all of the digits in the blanks are the given digit, which would have to be 8, and there can't be 88 digits in the box - at most 27. If a blank were 9, all of the digits would have to be the given digit except, presumably, that 9. But then there would be 24 digits different from 9, which contains two different digits, '2' and '4,' so 9 is ruled out.</p>

<p>Thus, we know every blank is a 2-digit number, so there are indeed 27 digits in total. Thus the average number of digits that aren't a given digit is (9*27 - 27)/9 = 24.</p>

<p>So I started by writing 24 in every blank. I then counted the number of each digit, and wrote what should be in the blanks in that case. Since only '2' and '4' appear in the blanks, the number of non-1 digits is 26, same as 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, while there are 17 non-2's and 17 non-4's. So I changed the blanks to 26, 17, 26, 17, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26. Then I counted again and corrected. After 11 iterations, I found that I hadn't changed any of the numbers, so I arrived at an answer, which I've written above.</p>

<p>I can't prove that it's unique though. Also, my method may have ended in a cycle, so I was lucky to have found a fixed point.</p>

<p>Ilmari's answer covers the logic of the answer perfectly, but in case anyone's still confused, here's a version of the diagram I find more intuitive (I made it myself while solving the puzzle).</p>

<p>The Pink squares are rooms where the princess could be on the given day, the blue squares are where the prince knocks that day, and the black squares are rooms in which she logically cannot be. On day 30 all rooms but room 2 have been eliminated, meaning that if the prince has not found the princess already, he will find her there on day 30.</p>

<h2><a name="solution12119"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/12119">Coin Flipping Game with the Devil</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">65 Votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/10615">Mike Earnest#10615</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/1752">Lopsy#1752</a></p>

<p>Satan should stick to fiddling. You will win, and here is a simple proof.</p>

<p>Consider the game $n$ turns at a time. After each cycle of $n$ turns, all the coins are in their original position (though not necessarily flipped the same way).</p>

<p>Replace $H$ with $0$ and $T$ with $1$.</p>

<p>In each cycle, you flip all $1$'s to $0$'s, until Satan flips a $0$ to a $1$. Once Satan makes a flip, you stop and leave the rest of this cycle's coins alone.</p>

<p>Satan must always make a flip during a cycle. If not, then you have just flipped all the coins to $0$, and you win.</p>

<p>Read the sequence of coins as a binary number. Each cycle's play starts at the ones place and progresses to the largest place. Satan makes the last flip in each cycle, and that flip flips a $0$ to a $1$. Therefore, after each cycle, the number gets larger.</p>

<p>But it can't get larger forever. After at most $2^n$ cycles, it reaches $111...1$. Put on your smuggest face and flip all the coins for a well-deserved win.</p>

  <p> It's best to start with the 1's and 9's, as they can only be placed on fields with only &lt;'s resp. &gt;'s, and work 'inwards' from there.

  <p> Let's start with the 1's.<br>
<br>
 * In the top-left 3x3, the top-left square is the only one with no &gt;'s.<br>

  <p> Now the 3's:<br>
<br>
 * The only square in the 6th column where you can place a 3 is the 4th one. The 2nd and 3rd are greater than the 4th one, the 8th is greater than the 9th and between the 9th and the '2' on that row we need another number.<br>
 * In the 8th row, the 1st square cannot be a three (it's greater than the square above it) and of the four rightmost squares, the one in the 8th column must have the lowest value of them all, so that's where the 3 goes.<br>
 * Now, in the middle-left 3x3, the only possible places for a '2' are the 4th row (the 6th row doesn't work because the central square cannot be '1.5'). This has consequences for the '2' and '3' in the middle-right 3x3; they can't occupy the 4th row or the 8th column and the square in the middle-right has three &gt;'s; that leaves the bottom-left and bottom-right square.<br>
 * This means the 3 in the middle-left 3x3 must go in the 5th row, and as it's the lowest number in that row (the 2 will go on the 4th row), it must be in the central square of that 3x3.<br>
 * The 3 in the 5th column can only go in the 1st square (the 3rd square is greater than the 3 to it's bottom right, and the 7th square is greater than its left neighbour which is at least 3).<br>
 * The bottom square of the 4th column can't be a 3 because its left neighbour can't be a 2. That leaves the 7th square as the only option.<br>

<p><a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B1SEThfCH9YWU2pBclMzc29rWDQ/thisisit" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here</a> you can find the files found in the recovered compressed file.
The ogg file is distorted, maybe somebody with better audio editing skills can figure out something. The pictures and filenames already tell enough for me though.</p>

<p><em>A shorter wrap-up of all the findings that lead to the result can be read here, but I also kept the original post with updates for those who are interested in the complete history of the discoveries.</em></p>

<p><em>I promised to share all the code I've written to solve this puzzle. I've cleaned them a little bit, and made them available <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B1SEThfCH9YWU2pBclMzc29rWDQ/tiledecoder_cleanversion.zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> (zip, ~30.5kB).</em></p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> The corners for positioning, the alignment bits around them and two extra white pixels in the middle are at the very same positions for the tiles of all three raven tilesets. If we rotate the tiles on the two-page document 180 degrees, they have all these bits in the very same positions too.<br>
<br>
 The pixels should be converted to a bitstream, using boustrophedon traversing: rows by two, alternating between left-to-right and right-to-left, inside those always column first, top to bottom. See the red arrows on the picture below for clarification. White pixels should be converted to 0, black ones to 1.<br>
<br>
 The forementioned two white pixels actually work as a separator between the header and body part of the bitstream. The header is 378 bits long, while the body consists of 2040 bits.<br>
<br>
 <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Oiao.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="images/4Oiao.png" alt="enter image description here"></a><br>
<br>
 The header should be read as 63 6-bit units. It uses a Reed-Solomon code with a message length of 15 units, and 67 as the primitve polynomial - just as it was given as a parameter for gfPow on the printout. If you don't know Reed-Solomon codes, you can think of it as a clever version of parity bits. The high redundancy it introduces allows us to recover the important 15-unit long main part of the header even if any 24 units (out of the 63) were corrupted. This 24 comes from an important parameter of the code, 2x24+1=49 is the so-called distance of the error correction, meaning that any two encoded words differ in at least 49 units. It is also not a coincidence, that 49=63-15+1, that is it is one larger than the difference of the block length and the message length. So the first 15 6-bit units are the important part of the header, the rest was there to make it possible to recover this first 15 if they are read imperfectly.<br>
<br>
 Even after the solution, most of these 15 6-bit units' meaning remained unknown, but we know that the last 4 is a counter. Each tile has a unique index, starting from zero, with an increment of one. The tiles were ordered according to this index in the raven-none and raven-ordered tilesets, but they were in a randomized order in the raven-random tileset and for the pages in the focus of the puzzle. For this latter, the largest index found was 2408 - suggesting there were at least 2409 tiles in this tileset, but only 2182 remained intact and were given in the tiles.zip provided by the official hint.<br>
<br>
 The only other 6-bit unit understood was the very first one. Its value serves as a parameter for how the body should be read - this was 16 for all the raven tilesets, but 20 for the last one.<br>
<br>
 The body uses Reed-Solomon error correcting codes as well, but with different parameters than the header. Here, units are 8 bits = 1 byte, and the block length is 255 bytes. The primitive polynomial is 301 for these (just as it was for rsgentest on the printout), the distance is 33 for the raven tilesets, and 41 for the tileset on the burnt paper. 33=2x16+1 and 41=2x20+1, so the first number in the header is the maximum number of errors that can be corrected in the message.<br>
<br>
 If a tile is successfully decoded, we're left with 223 correct bytes per tile in the raven tilesets, 215 in the document. But for some tilesets not all the tiles can be successfully decoded: raven-ordered suffered a spilled out coffee, and the two-page document got burnt. It is still possible to recover these, because of a second layer of Reed-Solomon codes. The raven tilesets use 223 bytes block length and 191 bytes message length, the two page document uses 215 bytes block length and 175 bytes message length. All the other parameters are the same they were in the first encoding.<br>
<br>
 For the raven-none tileset there is no interleaving, so the second layer is just another encoding on a single tile. But for all the other tilesets this second layer uses a diagonal structure: for example on the mysterious document the 617th block starts with the 1st byte of the 617th tile's , then the 2nd byte of the 618th tile's message follows, and so on, the last one in this block is the 215th byte of the 831st tile's message. Wherever it is needed, the indices wrap around, so the 2nd byte of the 2409th block is coming from the 2nd byte of the 1st tile's message (assuming that there are actually 2409 tiles in total, and not more).<br>
<br>
 A last problem was, that some of these blocks miss more than 20 bytes. However, in this case, the position of these wrong bytes are known (using coding theory terminology, in this case they are called erasures, not errors), and because of this, twice as many can be corrected. It is possible to recover all these blocks, extract the messages inside them, and you just have to concatenate them to get the original file. It is a bz2 file, containing a tar file, containing the three images and the audio file listed on the link above.  </p>

<p><strong>Original post (April 28)</strong><br>
Just some ideas which might lead someone somewhere:</p>

<p>First, </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> @ffao's answer already suggested the use of polynomials over finite fields. Might it be, that the 'rs' in the filenames means Reed-Solomon, which is a type of error-correcting codes, just as QR codes are? I don't see the maths matching, however.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I think the last page contains</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> three examples, what the encoding (with different parameters) produces on a sample text, probably Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven. At least that's what that filename suggests for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update #1 (July 6)</strong><br>
I finally decided to digitalize the images.
You can find the output as a zip of text files <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B1SEThfCH9YWU2pBclMzc29rWDQ/binary.zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> (~1.9MB).<br>
I used the numbered, cut out and aligned tiles from @2012rcampion's answer with hints. 1s represent whites, and 0s represent blacks. There are some errors in the conversion, as the blacks and whites weren't perfect, but hey, if it's QR, it should be prone to errors :).  </p>

<p>An even more cropped version can be found <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B1SEThfCH9YWU2pBclMzc29rWDQ/cropped.zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> (~1.6MB).<br>
The difference from the above one is that 4 bits are removed in every direction, so there is no overlap between two tiles, and the aligment bits are cut in quarters in this conversion.</p>

<p>Feel free to use them!</p>

<p><strong>Update #2 (July 7)</strong><br>
Sorry, I just realized that the cropped images were cropped too much (missing 4 important rows on the right and the bottom). I've corrected them, the link above now points to the corrected version.<br>
I also changed the threshold used to distinguish black and white cells. It's still not perfect, but seemed to be better then the previous one.</p>

<p><strong>Update #3 (July 7)</strong><br>
Using again the official hint answer,</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> this time the averaged pictures (for which the original idea comes from @WesleySitu). It seems that the alignment bits of the raven-* documents look like the bluish parts of <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B1SEThfCH9YWU2pBclMzc29rWDQ/raven_alignment_bits_and_traversing_order.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> (png, ~2.6kB).<br>
 <img src="images/xrv4m.png" alt="raven_aligment_bits_and_traversing_order"></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However,</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> the mysterious document's alignment bits do not match, until you rotate them 180 degrees, upside down. So I'm pretty sure @LeppyR64's observation about rotating them upside down before further processing is correct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update #4 (July 11)</strong><br>
Traversing the pixels in the order that @WesleySitu suggested, the raven-* codes turn into <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B1SEThfCH9YWU2pBclMzc29rWDQ/reordered_raven.zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">these</a> (zip, ~61.2kB) strings of 0s and 1s. If it is needed, I can convert the pages of the mysterious document too, but I think we should understand first what raven.txt went under.<br>
For clarification, the order in which the pixels are read goes to the following pattern:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> Neglect the alignment bits.<br>
 The rest is processed in rows of two, alternating from left to right, column first, from the top.<br>
 <img src="images/AGzH2.png" alt="raven_aligment_bits_and_traversing_order_2"></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update #5 (July 12)</strong><br>
As @2012rcampion pointed out, there was a bug in my code which was responsible for the order in which the pixels were read in. I've corrected it, and replaced the zip above.</p>

<p><strong>Update #6 (July 26)</strong><br>
I tried to run the lines (which I got with the method above) through a Reed-Solomon decoder with the standard parameters (n=255, k=223). The bytestream I got is not human readable. Either this is not the next step that should be done, the parameters are not-standard, or I messed up something. I tried it with white cells as 1s and blacks as 0s and vice versa as well.</p>

<p><strong>Update #7 (July 28)</strong><br>
I'm not yet sure how I did it, and the data seems to be dirty, but  </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> just as I guessed in my original post, the raven-* documents are the encoded version of Edgar Allen Poe's The Raven.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will be back after I manage to come up with a cleaner output.</p>

<p><strong>Update #8 (July 28)</strong><br>
So here's what I've found earlier today. It is still work in progress, but seems like I've managed to identify some parts of the tiles:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <img src="images/NdUnE.jpg" alt="raven_bit_clusters">  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What makes me to think this?  </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> I was parsing the files I linked above as the digitized versions of the raven-none tiles, and playing with different Reed-Solomon parameters and bit offsets. Some parts of the resulting bytestreams started to make sense for the human eye, and 'BANG!' I immediately recognized parts of the poem I first mentioned in this post exactly three months ago.<br>
<br>
 Decoding the 'actual message' part as bytes and converting them to the corresponding ASCII characters, the raven-* documents hold <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B1SEThfCH9YWU2pBclMzc29rWDQ/raven_message/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">these</a> messages.<br>
 I did not check, but I think the raven-ordered and raven-random messages are some permutations of the characters in raven-none message.<br>
<br>
 The numbers (191+32+32 bytes) match too nicely not to be some kind of Reed-Solomon codes (my other first impression in my original post), but I didn't yet manage to build those parts together in a way that it makes sense.<br>
<br>
 As the raven-none tiles don't have any black pixels in the last 32 bytes, I think those bits cannot be a part of the error correcting bits. My first idea was that they are also part of the actual message and have to be used to reorder the characters to get back the original message, but did not manage to get anywhere with this so far.<br>
<br>
 So our idea about how to traverse the bits is confirmed.<br>
 And if you are using my files, you have to invert 0s and 1s as it seems black pixels represent 1s, white pixels represent 0s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update #9 (July 29)</strong><br>
A correction again - there was a mistake in the bit cluster picture above.</p>

<p><strong>Update #10 (July 29)</strong><br>
I also figured out what to do with the ordered interleaving.  </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> Rows represent tiles (in order, so tile0000 is in the first row), and the columns are the bytes extracted with the same method I used for raven-none. Newlines and other special characters are replaced by '+'.

<p>Another new observation is, that  </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> the tiles in the raven-random image are the very same tiles as the ones in the raven-ordered image, the only difference being their order (ordered tile0000 is random tile0011, ordered tile0001 is random tile0003, and so on).<br>
 The name suggests their order is random, but maybe with the help of the interleaving bits they can be somehow sorted, and once they are ordered, the previous method can be used to get the content of the message.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Preparing for the worst, I suppose  </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> the mysterious document's pages are encoded with random interleaving, which means some characters (of the burnt tiles) will be missing every now and then from the message. Also those don't seem to have alphabetical characters, at least that's what their average's uniform gray color suggests. We will see soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update #11 (July 31)</strong><br>
I was working on turning the mysterious pages into bits when I read @TusanHomichi's results, and his suggestion to redigitize the tiles.<br>
I tried to do my best, played a lot with ImageMagick commands, and although it's still not 100%, I managed to </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> get a new version of the raven-* tiles, which gives an almost perfect bitstream - even before the error correcting is done. Of course I still converted the mysterious document as well. White pixels are decoded as 0 this time. You can find all these files <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B1SEThfCH9YWU2pBclMzc29rWDQ/bitstreams_v2.zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> (zip, ~1.5MB).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using these, and @TusanHomichi's observations about </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> the header, I managed to come up with the <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B1SEThfCH9YWU2pBclMzc29rWDQ/tileorder.txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">correct order of 2055 tiles of the mysterious document</a> (txt, ~25.2kB). 'l' and 'r' stands for left and right page, the 4-digit number is the index of the tile as it was given in the zip provided by @2012rcampion. There are some holes in the sequence, but not that much. I estimate the missing number of tiles around 350-360.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update #12 (July 31)</strong><br>
After these findings, I returned to work on</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> the message parts of the now ordered tiles. As @TusanHomichi noted earlier, the error correcting codes do not work in most of the cases, I managed to decode only 507 tiles.<br>
 So I tried to brute force some parameters, namely I replaced the modulus of 301 with all the possible irreducible 7-degree polynomials over GF(2). None of those helped to decode, not even a single tile.<br>
 Thus it seems, the modulus 301 is hardcoded in the encoding procedure, and this makes sense, as it wasn't given in the command line during the raven encodings.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However,</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> there is another parameter, which was: '-t 16'. I've also noticed that the first and the seventh 6-bit chunk of the header of the raven tiles has the value of 16. For the mysterious document, the seventh is also 16, but the first one is 20. So maybe it was encoded with '-t 20'. But what that t means is still unclear. As another '--t=4' appears in the arguments of the run of rsgentest, I suspect it is worth looking for in that direction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a less serious sidenote,</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> another command line parameter of the encoding was '-s 6x6'. Probably it was for the shape. And what could be the shape parameter for the mysterious document's command?<br>
 It definitely has 30 columns and at least 40 rows, that's 2400 tiles on the two pages altogether. We also know, that the pages were upside down, and the last row is full, suggesting, that the number of tiles printed on those two pages is divisible by 30. Furthermore, in the headers we've seen indices in the range between 0 and 2408. So we have at least 2409 tiles, maybe a little bit more, if the ones with the largest indices are among the burnt ones. But it is very unlikely that there are 21 in a row lost, which would complete a full row. So probably there was another page with the last 9 or slightly more tiles in the office.<br>
 Haven't you found anything like that, @2012rcampion? Maybe at that time you didn't happen to realize it is the last part of this document, but you still picked it up with all the other papers. Not that we need some more tiles that much, but maybe there is some other important information (a.k.a. hint) on that piece of paper...</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update #13 (August 1)</strong><br>
Further optimizing my digitizing process, I managed to </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> get the counter in the header for all the tiles provided. I had to do the last 14 manually, but hopefully there aren't any errors. The file I linked yesterday about the correct order of the tiles is now updated. Of course the burnt tiles are missing, so are the ones which did not fit on the pages.<br>
 The message parts can be decoded with my current method for about 1700 out of 2182. I will publish those soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update #14 (August 1)</strong><br>
I started publishing </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> the message bytestreams of the tiles (now ordered according to the counters inside them). You can find all the encoded messages and the succesfully decoded ones <strike>here</strike> [<strong>EDIT</strong>: link removed with update #16]. The set of the latter is continuously updated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update #15 (August 1)</strong><br>
<strike>Here</strike> [<strong>EDIT</strong>: outdated, see update #18] you can find my current best attempt as the target file's reconstruction. Some assumptions I used:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> I assumed that the tile index 2408 what we saw is the actual largest, so there are 2409 tiles in total.<br>
 Wherever the decoding was successful, I used its outcome. If the decoding failed, I used the corresponding byte of the encoded version. If the whole tile was missing, I used the byte 0xff, as a simple frequency analysis showed there are more black pixels than white ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If anyone can open it with something, let me know. I guess it still has too many corrupted bits to be opened.</p>

<p><strong>Update #16 (August 2)</strong><br>
For some tiles the main problem was </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> a one pixel translation into x or y direction. Identifying these tiles and realigning them before processing allowed me to encode further 174 of them. Now there are 1910 which can be perfectly decoded. The link above to the reconstructed file is updated.<br>
 I removed the link from update #14 to the decoded and encoded versions of the tiles, as they are not that helpful. <strike>Here</strike> is a zip of undecoded tiles instead [<strong>EDIT</strong>: no more tiles left unsolved].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update #17 (August 2)</strong><br>
Further finetuning of</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> parameters in my ImageMagick scripts allowed me to decode all but 5 tiles. The reconstructed file and the 5 problematic tiles are now available on the links above.<br>
 These tiles seem to be tricky, probably they need manual corrections, but it's getting late here, and I just cannot focus with my eyes any more today. Maybe someone else is more fresh to do that.<br>
 I still don't know what to do with the restored file. Maybe it needs the last 5 tiles. Maybe even with those a good enough reconstruction is impossible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update #18 (August 3)</strong><br>
I'm done with  </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> manually correcting the last 5 tiles. I've updated the reconstructed file. My system automatically detects it as a .bz2 file, but still cannot open it. Maybe it has some error correcting structure, or it can be restored with some data restoring software.<br>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <a href="http://www.bzip.org/1.0.3/html/recovering.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">short description</a> about what kind of error correction is used for .bz2 files, and managed to use the recovering tool mentioned there on the 2409-tile version above (it fails on the other one). <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B1SEThfCH9YWU2pBclMzc29rWDQ/recovered.bz2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This</a> is the result, but I still cannot open it.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update #20 (August 6)</strong><br>
I realised, that</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> there is another layer of Reed-Solomon encoding inside the encoded versions of the tiles, with block length of 215 bytes, and message length of 175 bytes. The blocks go across tiles, so it might be possible to restore the missing tiles and thus the missing parts of the file, but so far I've only managed to recover only about half of the blocks. The file remains corrupted.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update #21 (August 7)</strong><br>
As a second tought, I'm not sure about</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> the message length being 175 bytes. Do you remember the number 16 in one of the 6-bit chunks in the header? Maybe it means the maximal distance for the error correction, and then the message should be 183 bytes.<br>
 Anyway, it seems the only direction going forwards is to decode some more tiles, which weren't provided in the post with the official hints. There aren't too many, but maybe just enough to get inside the maximal distance, and have a successful decoding for all of the blocks.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update #22 (August 8)</strong><br>
I'm now working on  </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> extracting some more tiles from the original pictures. There are about 116 partial tiles, <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B1SEThfCH9YWU2pBclMzc29rWDQ/moretiles.zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> are the rotated versions of some which give some hope to be recovered.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update #23 (August 10)</strong><br>
It seems like  </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> the message length is 175 bytes, at least I manage to decode more parts with this parameter. This means that the 215 byte block can have 20 bytes wrong. Because of the diagonal structure, a part of the bz2 file can be recovered if we have at least 215-20=195 tiles of every consecutively indexed sequence of tiles - that is, the first part needs at least 195 tiles from tiles indexed between 0 and 214, the second part needs at least 195 tiles from tiles indexed between 1 and 215, and so on.<br>
 Well, the original tiles.zip does not contain enough tiles to cover all these sequences sufficiently: for example, we have only 185 tiles with indices in the range [165, 379], so I don't see how the corresponding part of the file can be recovered without knowing some more tiles with indices in that range.<br>
 So I'm now hunting more tiles. Some more which I managed to decode successfully are the ones marked with blue here: <br>
 <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KLP2t.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="images/KLP2t.jpg" alt="more tiles of the left page"></a> <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AKdJY.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="images/AKdJY.jpg" alt="more tiles of the right page"></a><br>
 The first few were possible to extract without manual work, but the task is getting more and more tricky. It obviously offers only a limited number of tiles to be recovered. Probably not even enough to recover the missing parts of the file.<br>
<br>
 The method worked very well with the raven-ordered file where some tiles were too badly corrupted themselves, but the diagonal error coding made it possible to recover them. 
 However, maybe there is another direction which we should go for these pages, as we don't have enough tiles for the diagonal decoding. I'll still keep hunting for tiles for a while though.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update 24 (August 11)</strong><br>
Finally <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B1SEThfCH9YWU2pBclMzc29rWDQ/thisisit.bz2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> is the recovered file.  </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> It is a bz2, extracting it you get a tar, extracting that you get 3 pictures and an audio file. I'm still having troubles playing the audio, but the pictures suggest I shouldn't even tell anybody I've ever seen them or heard the message on the audio.</p>

<p>Yes, the policeman can catch the thief, although it may take a very long time. In particular, the following strategy works: The policeman starts in the center. First, he makes a counterclockwise loop around the top right quadrant. Then, he makes a counterclockwise loop around the top left quadrant. Then, he makes a counterclockwise loop around the bottom left quadrant. He continues making such loops until he catches the thief, each time moving to the next quadrant in counterclockwise order. The strategy is illustrated in the following picture, where he executes the red arrows, then the green arrows, then the blue arrows, then the yellow arrows, and then repeat the whole process ad nauseam. The diagram below labels the four steps in each counterclockwise loop from $1$ to $4$, which will be useful in discussing the strategy.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V40vY.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/V40vY.jpg" alt="Diagram of the described strategy"></a></p>

<p>In the comments, @f'' points out that this strategy may also be described as follows: The policeman walks around the perimeter counterclockwise. Each time he reaches the midpoint of an edge, he walks into the center and then back out, continuing his traversal of the perimeter from where he left off.  </p>

<p>To show that this works, let us first notice that the thief can never safely visit the center of Squareshire. This is because, for her to do so, she would have to run from the perimeter to the center and then back in the time it takes the policeman to make one loop. However, this requires her to run past two edges in the time the policeman runs four, which she cannot do. </p>

<p>In particular, this "disconnects" the center in a way, meaning that, if the thief is not in the center, there is a unique point $P$ on the perimeter where she last left the perimeter, and where she must later enter the perimeter again. This will always be a midpoint of one of the outer edges. An important property is that the thief is no better off leaving the perimeter, then coming back, than she is just standing at point $P$. That is, if she leaves the perimeter at a point $P$, and the policeman then sees that point, she will be surely caught.</p>

<p>To show this, consider what happens during the policeman's first loop around the top left quadrant. If $P$ is the midpoint of the top edge, then the policeman sees it after walking two edges. It continues to be visible to the policeman until he reaches the midpoint of the top edge, at which point he sees everywhere the thief could safely be*. If $P$ is the midpoint of the left edge, then the policeman must have already travelled more than one edge before the policeman enters, and the first time the policeman will see $P$ is when he returns to the center. He will also see the whole edge connecting to $P$, so the thief will die regardless of whether she stayed at $P$, or ventured inwards. The case for the midpoint of the bottom or left edges is similar.</p>

<p>This establishes that, if the thief can survive, she can do so while staying on the perimeter. However, the policeman is "sweeping" the perimeter faster than she can move. In particular, let us label every point of the perimeter by a number** with the numbers increasing in the counterclockwise direction such that the difference between two labels is proportional to the distance between them, as walked on the perimeter. We will consider that $1$ and $0$ represent the same point:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Wjuw.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/0Wjuw.jpg" alt="the perimeter labelled as described, with 0 at the right-hand midpoint, then quarter, half, three quarters counterclockwise at the other midpoints"></a></p>

<p>During the policeman's first loop, he is able to see the point $0$, then for a while sees all the points in $[-1/8,1/8]$, then sees all the points in $[1/8,3/8]$. On his way back to the center, he sees the point $1/4$. Then, on the next loop around, he sees the same sequence of points, just shifted by $1/4$ forwards, to signify that he is now sweeping the next quadrant. The significance is that the thief can travel at most some constant amount less than $1/4$ around the perimeter in each of these steps, so the policeman's view eventually catches up. A plot of this is provided below, where the thief's position on the perimeter is a yellow line, running as fast as it can away, and the policeman's view is the shaded region bounded by blue and purple lines. The $x$-axis gives the distance walked by the policeman as a fraction of the perimeter.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NzJlw.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/NzJlw.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>The important note here is that the thief's line is limited in slope to some constant less than $1/2$, whereas the policeman's view is moving forwards with an average slope of $1/2$. The thief wishes to avoid her line intersecting the policeman's view, but this is, of course, impossible.</p>

<p>(*Note that the thief could have run across the center so that the policeman doesn't see her until he returns to the center, but we already established that running through the center is a fatal mistake, so we assume the thief doesn't do this.)</p>

<p>(**For mathematicians, we're really considering the perimeter to be $\mathbb R/\mathbb Z$, and then lifting both the policeman's view and the thief's position to $\mathbb R$)</p>

<h2><a name="solution15725"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/15725">Discover the meaning of life!</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">58 Votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/11475">Bailey M#11475</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5208">Alconja#5208</a></p>

<p>So, standing on the shoulders of giants, and adding in the answers to two remaining stanzas, we get the final complete solution (as <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/16464/5208">noted by Quassnoi</a>), to discover that life is indeed:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>PUZZLING</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Looking at the riddle, it's fairly obvious that the clues are cryptic, but there's a little more to it than that. As hinted, the final stanza tells us <em>how</em> to approach the puzzle beyond these cryptic clues.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Between the lines you'll find your answer, definitively twisted;<br>
  yet in the shadows aligned so clearly you'll be surprised you missed it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>definitively twisted</em> part hints to us that the stanzas not only contain a word discovered through cryptic clues, but also the definition of the answer to one of the other stanzas. So as we solve cryptic clues, we can validate these answers by looking for words/phrases elsewhere to find synonyms/definitions thereof.</p>

<p>The <em>in the shadows aligned</em> part of the clue will become apparent at the very end...</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, stanza by stanza we have:</p>

<p><strong>Stanza 1:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To start, stay within the pathway of general glee,<br>
  though stay clear of the law faery, who flits about wildly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Giving us:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>PATHOGEN</strong>, by staying within PATHway Of GENeral, avoiding each of the letters from "law faery" (once each), <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/16250/5208">as shown by Pete</a>. This is of course synonymous with virus, from stanza 6.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Stanza 2:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The road third-least taken leads to you and I in flight.<br>
  Head north 'til you see the reverse, then once more north to the burial site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Giving us:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>QUINCUNX</strong>, by way of Q (the third least common letter for a word to start with), U &amp; I (in flight), then N(orth) CU (U C reversed), N(orth), X (marks the spot). The definition of which ("an arrangement of five objects with four at the corners of a square or rectangle and the fifth at its center") can be found in the first line of stanza 3.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Stanza 3:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When five becomes square, it may lead to confusion;<br>
  behead the basilisk, an ironic inclusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Giving us:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>WIZARDRY</strong> (again <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/16250/5208">as from Pete</a>), from a beheaded basilisk (aka lizard) to get IZARD, included in WRY (irony). The synonym, sorcery, is found in stanza 4.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Stanza 4:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before two sharp curves and the ring of sorcery,<br>
  stand still, close your eyes, and count aloud past three.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Giving us:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>FORZANDO</strong>, once more <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/16250/5208">found by Pete</a>, based on FOR (what you hear when you count past three), Z (two sharp curves) AND O (a ring). The definition of forzando in music is to play forcefully, as seen in stanza 8.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Stanza 5:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the air - do you hear it? The water baby screams.<br>
  Let our own misgivings start and end in our dreams.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Giving us:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>HEIRLOOM</strong>, <em>again</em> <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/16250/5208">from Pete</a>, because HEIR (sounds like air) plus the start letters of L(et) O(ur) O(wn) M(isgivings) at the end. With the synonym being keepsake from stanza 7.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Stanza 6:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A quixotic elf and I stand at the gates -<br>
  succumb to the virus, and the city awaits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Giving us:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>FELICITY</strong>, as <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/16464/5208">solved by Quassnoi</a>, derived from FEL (anagram of elf), I, and then CITY. Felicity means happiness, or glee, as seen in stanza 1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Stanza 7:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As you approach the arbor, I wait in between.<br>
  Clutch your keepsake as the first enemy's heard and seen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Giving us:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>AIRBORNE</strong>, again <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/16464/5208">from Quassnoi</a>, since we put I into ARBOR (airbor), and add N (first letter "heard" in enemy), and E (first letter "seen" in enemy). The definition, "in flight" is found in stanza 2.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Stanza 8:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will being stuck in all this goo truly help you see?<br>
  Primarily, primarily; whip around, forcefully.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Giving us:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <strong>POLLIWOG</strong>, by whipping around (reversing), the letters from WILL stuck in the letters of GOO (i.e. gowillo reversed), but starting with P (start of primarily). A polliwog is a tadpole, or a water baby from stanza 5.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Bringing all these words together, we end up with eight eight letter words:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">

<h2><a name="solution46493"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/46493">This is it. This is the one. Save your wife</a></h2>

<p>This is a comprehensive and complete roundup of the answers submitted by various users and brought together by the OP. A lot of this was solved in chat, mainly by Deusovi, Rubio, Techidiot and Volatility.</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p>The first letters of each paragraph say '<strong>NICE TRY</strong>'. So we need to look somewhere else...<br>
The italics say '<em>check the last letters</em>', so looking at the last letters of each paragraph, from bottom to top, you get '<strong>BACK TEN</strong>'.<br>
Going back, counting ten words each time like we counted forward nine in save your wife, and starting from the last word of the last paragraph you get the message:
<br><br>
"<strong>Last letters of the words can move forward to be the first of the next word, but reverse each of them before hand. I fear that I will not see you again. Please help me.</strong>"
<br><br>
This seems to point towards the supposedly 'meaningless' letters. By reversing each word and then moving the last letter of each word forward you get the riddle:
<br><br>
<strong>'I'm some small devil or sprite,</strong><br>
<strong>who merged with danger.</strong><br>
<strong>But things were not alright.</strong><br>
<strong>When it did not turn off.</strong><br>
<strong>They said something about learning,</strong><br>
<strong>or at least something similar to that,</strong><br>
<strong>I'm trapped but also the key.'</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer to this is</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p><strong>IMPRISONED</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p>An 'IMP' is a small devil or sprite<br>
A 'RISK' is a danger<br>
Take away 'K' to get 'RIS' because things were not alright (OK)<br>
'ON' is the opposite of off, and 'it did not turn off' 
'ED' stands for education which is a synonym of learning<br>
IMP+RIS+ON+ED = IMPRISONED<br>
'IMPRISONED' means trapped and 'key' suggests a vigenere cipher.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each algebraic equation:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p>can be simplified. For instance, the first one - '$2P + 3N - P - 2N + 3E$ - can be simplified to $1P + 1N + 3E$. These are actually directions from a compass.
<br><br>$1P$ means the P in the first paragraph of the book. There is only one - it's in 'upon'. In each simplified equation, there is only one in the paragraph of the first letter. Using the example of the simplified one above:<br>
$1N$ means go 1 letter North<br>
$3E$ means go 3 letters East<br>
Doing this we get the letter 'O' in 'your'.
<br><br>
We should also note that 4 equations give the words 'SPACE', 'GAP, 'VOID' and 'BLANK' when simplified which suggest a space in a sentence.<br>
<br><br>
The number and the letter at the start of each equation are the paragraph number and the letter in it which is the only one. The rest are directions, but it is important to simplify so that the letters are in the order they appear in the equation because $3E+3N$ won't be the same as $3N+3E$ due to letters not being exactly above each other and different width letters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doing this for every equation gives:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p>The phrase '<strong>oa abfos.wtj aaamm fizfhze ansXv.jpg</strong>'. The '<strong>C</strong>' in the 29th equation indicates capitalisation.

<p><strong>EPILOGUE FROM OP:</strong> </p>

<p>Realizing where your wife is, you scrabble around on the floor. There must be a trapdoor somewhere as you've already checked every room. You eventually find it hidden under a rug. Lifting the trapdoor up reveals a flight of stairs leading down to a door. It is locked on the outside. You scramble inside and find your wife gagged against the wall. You untie her and she falls tearfully into your arms. After all that effort, you're finally reunited with your wife. You both found her and saved her. </p>

<p><strong>You solved the puzzle...</strong></p>

<p>We can decode each phrase by ..</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> ... taking words in pairs. Each word pair represents a letter (or character) and the lengths of these pairs taken as hex number yield the ASCII code of that letter. In other words, the ASCII code is:<br>

 <em>c</em> = 16 &middot; (length(<em>w</em>) &minus; 1) + hex(last(<em>w</em>))</p>

<p>With this method, the first phrase becomes:</p>

<p>It's hard to be sure with all this sand in my eyes, but I believe the desert is saying:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p><strong>CACTUS</strong></p>

<p><em>Reasoning</em>:</p>

<p>Firstly, the title and the fact that the only numbers used in the grains of sand are 1 - 12, hint towards a clock face.
From here, we can treat numbers as directions, such that from any given point, you just take the number given and travel according to the associated hour direction:  </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p><img src="images/UdURJ.png" alt="each number on the clock face points at the next point on the path"></p>

<p>Additional note</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> We note the double pawns occur on the f file. A potential question could be whether we could remove any of the pawns and still have the board position reachable legally. The answer is that no pawn removal matters. For example, if we removed the a7 pawn, the pawn that is currently at f2 originally started at a7 and with sequential captures traversed a7, b6, c5, etc to reach f2. We can similarly show that for any other pawn from any file, the pawn at f2 could have started from that file and reached f2 legally.</p>

<h2><a name="solution26180"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/26180">Three mathematicians are forever in Prison</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">53 Votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/19009">LFH#19009</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/2627">Julian Rosen#2627</a></p>

<p>The night before their first day in prison, the mathematicians choose a non-principal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrafilter">ultrafilter</a> on the set of days they are in prison. A non-principal ultrafilter is a rule for classifying some sets of days as <em>large</em>, and the rest as <em>small</em>, subject to the following conditions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Every set of days containing a large set is large,</li>
<li>If the set of all days is partitioned into finitely many sets, exactly one set is large, and</li>
<li>No finite set of days is large.</li>
</ol>

<p>Constructing a non-principal ultrafilter requires the axiom of choice, and communicating an ultrafilter from one mathematician to another requires an infinite amount of information. These mathematicians have unlimited mental capacity though, so maybe this is possible.</p>

<p>After the countably infinite number of days has passed, each mathematician guesses <strong>dark mode</strong> if the set of days when their light was off is large, and guesses <strong>bright mode</strong> if the set of days their light was on is large (property 2 above guarantees that exactly of these conditions is met).</p>

<p>Suppose warden eventually selects <strong>dark mode</strong>. Consider the following four sets of days:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>neutral mode</strong> days,</li>
<li><strong>dark mode</strong> days when the first mathematician's light is on,</li>
<li><strong>dark mode</strong> days when the second mathematician's light is on,</li>
<li><strong>dark mode</strong> days when the third mathematician's light is on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, property 2 of the ultrafilter says that exactly one of these sets of days is large. By property 3, it cannot be the first, because that set is finite. This means exactly one of the mathematicians saw a light for a large set of days, so that mathematician guesses <strong>bright mode</strong> and the other two guess <strong>dark mode</strong>. Success!</p>

<p>The argument in the case the warden selects <strong>bright mode</strong> is identical.</p>

<h2><a name="solution36479"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/36479">Is this chromatic puzzle always solvable?</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">53 Votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/17558">Edgar G.#17558</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/2328">user3294068#2328</a></p>

<p>Yes, it's possible.</p>

<p>Start with the various 2x2 squares.
Ignoring symmetries of rotation and color swapping, there are 1 combination of 1 color, 3 combinations of 2 colors, and 2 combinations of 3 colors.  It is simple to brute-force these 6 combinations to show that each can be changed to a 2x2 square of 1 color.  For example:</p>

<p>$$ {12 \choose 31} \to {2 2 \choose 21 } \to {22 \choose 33} \to {12 \choose 13} \to {11 \choose 11}$$</p>

<p>So, to start, convert each of the 2x2 squares to 1 color, each.</p>

<p>If one has two adjacent 2x2 squares of different colors, the first step is to swap the touching colors:</p>

<p>$$ {1122 \choose 1122} \to {1332 \choose 1122} \to {1232 \choose 1222} \to {1212 \choose 1212}$$</p>

<p>For simplicity, call this process "swap", and denote it with $\implies$.</p>

<p>To make two 2x2 squares of different colors into one 2x4 block of one color:</p>

<p>$${1122 \choose 1122} \implies {1212 \choose 1212} \to {3312 \choose 1212} \to
{3312 \choose 3312} \to {3333 \choose 3312} \to {3333 \choose 3333} $$</p>

<p>Do this with all adjacent pairs of 2x2 blocks (that are not the same color already).  You now have 8 2x4 blocks.</p>

<p>To combine two 2x4 blocks of different colors, repeat the swap procedure until all the columns alternate, then apply dominoes horizontally to make all the colors the same.</p>

<p>$$ {11112222 \choose 11112222} \implies {11121222 \choose 11121222} \implies {11211222 \choose 11211222} \implies {12111222 \choose 12111222} \\
\implies {12112122 \choose 12112122} \implies {12121122 \choose 12121122}
\implies {12121212 \choose 12121212}  \\
 \to {33121212 \choose 12121212} \to {33331212 \choose 12121212}... {33333333 \choose 33333333}$$</p>

<p>Do this to each row, yielding 4 blocks of 2x8.</p>

<p>Next, perform the same process using columns of 2 blocks instead of rows.  Since all the squares in each row are already the same color, the process will yield an entire 8x8 square all one color.</p>

<p>This process can be extended to any rectangle where the number of rows and columns are powers of 2 (>=2).</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
It is possible to solve for any $m\times n$ rectangle, so long a $m$ and $n$ are each not divisible by 3.</p>

<p><em>Solution:</em>  make all the squares in each row a single color, using only horizontal dominoes.  Repeat process vertically to make all the squares in each column a single color, using only vertical dominoes.</p>

<p><em>Proof that this is possible:</em>  Assign each color a value in ${1,2,3}$.  Applying a domino does not change the sum of the values, modulo 3, for example $1 + 3 \equiv 2 + 2 \mod 3$.  Since $m$ is not divisible by 3, we know that $m$, $2m$, and $3m$ have distinct values modulo 3.  For each row, determine the sum of the color values, $S$, and find the color $i$ such that $S \equiv m i\mod 3$.  That's the target color for the row.</p>

<p>Obviously, if $m = 2$, then either the colors are the same and we are done, or they are different, and a single domino will make them the same.  So we focus on $m \geq 4$.  Take the first $4$ squares, which have values $a, b, c,$ &amp; $d$.  It is possible to apply dominoes such to reach $XXXY$, where $X$ is the target color, and $Y = a+b+c+d\mod 3$ (unless $a = b= c= d = Y$).</p>

<p>Proof of this by brute force is tedious, but there are only 81 cases to consider.  By way of example:</p>

<p>$$ aabb \to accb \to bbcb \to baab \to bacc \to bbbc \\
\to bbaa \to bcca \to aaca \to abba \to abcc \to aaac \\
\to aabb \to accb \to bbcb \to baab \to bacc \to cccc
$$ </p>

<p>That path covers 14 of the 81 cases (with some duplicates).  No matter what the target color, each of those cases can reach it, except $cccc$.</p>

<p>For each row, determine your target color, $X$.  Use this process to set the first three squares  to your target color, possibly also changing the value of the fourth square (see caveat below for when this is not possible).  Repeat for each group of 3 squares until you have only 1 or 2 left.  </p>

<p>If you have 1 left, then that square must now be your target color.</p>

<p>If you have 2 left, then either they are both your target color, or neither is.  If neither is, apply a domino to make them both your target color.</p>

<p>Caveat: it may be the case that for a given group of four squares, they are already all the same color, and that color is not your target color.  In that case, skip the first three and work on the next set of squares.  When you reach the end, then work your way backward.  The last set you skipped must now be $YYYX$, which you can convert to $XXXX$.  Continue until you are done.</p>

<p>This process will convert a single row to all the same color, using only horizontal dominoes.</p>

<p>When you have converted each row to a single color, you can then proceed to do the same with each column, using vertical dominoes.  Since each column now contains the same pattern, the result must be at the end that all squares are the same color.</p>

<p>Two things jumped out at me as soon as I saw this puzzle.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Firstly, the mixed-case letter strings on the far right. Several of them look like</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> country names with certain letters removed. For instance, <strong>Srb</strong> -> Serbia, <strong>ussi</strong> -> Russia, and <strong>Nrwy</strong> -> Norway.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Secondly, the all-caps letter strings in the middle. Several of them start with what look like</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> words from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strike>NATO</strike> IACO phonetic alphabet</a>. Reading down, we can immediately spot JULI(E)T, INDIA, HOT(E)L, DELT(A), GOLF, VICTOR.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>Looking at it a little more closely, I noticed that</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> the letters missing from the country names seem to be identical in each line to the letters removed from the <strike>NATO</strike> IACO phonetic alphabet words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let's fill in some of those letters and see where we get:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">

</blockquote>

<p>On each line, the all-caps part deciphers to</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> three letters, which together with the context of the message suggests <strong>airport codes</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore,</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> the airport given by this three-letter code is in the country given by the right-most part of the <em>previous</em> line! For instance, in 2008, BEG is Nikola Tesla Airport in Belgrade, <strong>Serbia</strong> - the country mentioned in 2007.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having noticed this connection, I actually used it quite a lot to help me find some of the missing letters to reconstruct the above.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/46412/5373">Sconibulus</a>, these correspond to</p>

<p>Looking at the linked table, we can now spot that the number on the far left of each line in the puzzle corresponds to</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> the date of the ESC (you did mention that the messages come "every year around the same time"). E.g. for 2010, the number 5.8 equals 29/5 and the ESC was on the 29th of May.</p>

  <p> There are three sudoku: a cyan one, a magenta one, and a yellow one<br>
 (blue=magenta+cyan; green=cyan+yellow; red=magenta+yellow; black=magenta+cyan+yellow).<br>

The exit wall is repeated cyan, magenta and yellow pixels (could there be three rooms or is that just a hint for the colours employed?)<br>
<br>
There is a grey 2 at the top-right of the bottom-right block  - do we need to also "get this free"?<br>

 If I got it all right, then all three are uniquely solvable with the grey 2, without it: Cyan has 38 solutions (only one has a 2 there, 20 have a 4, 11 have a 5, 6 have a 9); Magenta still has just the one solution; Yellow has 4 solutions, the other three having a 1 in the grey 2's place.<br>

<h2><a name="solution15097"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/15097">Who shall come to the tea party?</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">52 Votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/9286">Trevor Powell#9286</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/12109">mmking#12109</a></p>

<p>All but Mr. Bun will attend the tea party, with Duke Froggington II as the guest of honor. The total number of animals who will be attending the party is $(6*12+2)-1=73$.</p>

<p>Looking at some specific cases:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>One animal left: he will definitely nominate himself.</p></li>
<li><p>Two animals left: each animal knows that if he nominates himself, there will only be one left, and that one will definitely nominate himself. So neither will nominate himself.</p></li>
<li><p>Three animals left: each animal knows that if he nominates himself, there will be two animals left, and neither will nominate himself. So the first animal to be asked will nominate himself.</p></li>
<li><p>Four animals left: each animal knows that if he nominates himself, there will be three animals left, and one will nominate himself. So none will nominate himself.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So using backward induction, if there are $n$ animals left, the strategy taken will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>If $n$ is even, no one will nominate himself.</li>
<li>If $n$ is odd, the first one asked will nominate himself.</li>
</ul>

<p>When Duke Froggington II takes his turn, there are 73 animals left (including himself). As he is a perfect logician, he will nominate himself as the guest of honor. No one else will nominate himself after him. So poor Mr. Bun gets sent to the toy box, while everyone else enjoys the tea party and Duke Froggington II hogs the strawberry pastry.</p>

<p>The lockets and coffins are always found in loops.</p>

<ol>
<li>open a coffin</li>
<li>look at the number of the locket in the coffin</li>
<li>go to the coffin with the same number as the locket</li>
<li>open the coffin</li>
<li>repeat from 2</li>
</ol>

<p>At one point you will definitely find the locket of the coffin you first opened</p>

<p>To prove this lets look at the other possibility and try to enter a loop without the first coffin in it.</p>

<p>This is impossible, as any locket which would be needed to enter that second loop would have to be included in the second loop itself and therefore can't be used to enter it.</p>

<p>Now that we know that all coffins are ordered in one or more loops we can easily define a strategy for 100% success:</p>

<p>Van Helsing: </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p>Find (if it exists) a loop that contains more than 500 coffins (there can be at most one such loop since we only have 1000 coffins) and switch two lockets in that loop so that two new loops with each 500 or less coffins are created.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jonathan Harker: </p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p>Start with the coffin with the number <strong>N</strong> as stated by Dracula and follow the loop until you find the locket with the number <strong>N</strong>. As no loop will have more than 500 coffins it doesn't matter which number dracula chooses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To understand splitting of loops:</p>

<p>Imagine 4 coffins 1,2,3,4 with the lockets 2,3,4,1 (in that order).</p>

<p>We now have a loop of size 4.</p>

<p>If we now switch the lockets of coffin 2 and 4 we get coffins 1,2,3,4 with lockets 2,1,4,3 (in that order).</p>

<p>So now we have two loops of size 2 (namely 1,2 and 3,4).</p>

<p>I started by figuring out which of the segments were broken. To do this, I used the following rules:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> 1) The first number on each clock has to be a 1 or a 0. If it was most of a 0, that meant the rest of it had to be filled in.<br>
 2) The third number on each clock has to be less than 6. This meant that, even though there were multiple possible numbers that could come from some of the partial numbers, there was only one that worked.<br>
 3) After those, I filled in numbers that could only be one other thing. There were only a couple pieces left at this point, so there weren't too many possibilities.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using those rules, I found that the times on the clocks were:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p>  <code>09:57, 06:55, and 10:28</code>. 
  <br>Adding 11 minutes, the times become<br>
  <code>10:08, 07:06, and 10:39</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that, 11 minutes into the escape, taking broken lines into account, the clocks would look like:</p>

<h2><a name="solution16055"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/16055">Eccentric Millionaire Probability Paradox</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">51 Votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/2722">Tyler Seacrest#2722</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/4479">JS1#4479</a></p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> First of all, Alice is correct in that the expected value of the strategy (from her point of view) is now -1000.  It would have been best if she had not been summoned to an office, in which case the couple would have won 5000.  Since she has been summoned to an office, that possibility is ruled out.  Let's look at the various possibilities.  I will shorten the cases to A, B, and AB, where A means Alice was picked alone, B means Bob was picked alone, and AB means both were picked.  I will use the term equity to mean the expected value of a case multiplied by the probability of that case.<br>
<br>
 A summary of the original possibilities:<br>
<br>
 A : +5000 (25% chance) (+1250 equity)<br>
 B : +5000 (25% chance) (+1250 equity)<br>
 AB: -4000 (50% chance) (-2000 equity)<br>
 Total equity: +500 (as stated in "The Plan")<br>
<br>
 A summary of the remaining possibilities once Alice is selected:<br>
<br>
 A : +5000 (33% chance) (+1667 equity)<br>
 AB: -4000 (67% chance) (-2667 equity)<br>
 Total equity: -1000 (as stated in "The Paradox")<br>
<br>
 This all makes sense so far.  There was a 75% chance of Alice being selected, with expected value -1000, and a 25% chance of Alice not being selected, with expected value +5000.<br>
<br>
 -1000 * 0.75 + 5000 * 0.25 = 500 equity, which is the original equity.<br>
<br>
 So far so good.  But Alice should still press the button.  Why?  Because her equity from pressing the button is positive:<br>
<br>
 A: +5000 (33% chance) (+1667 equity)<br>
 AB: -2000 (67% chance) (-1333 equity)<br>
 Total equity: +333<br>
<br>
 Note that in the AB case, her pressing the button only loses 2000 dollars and not 4000.  Bob pressing his button and losing the other 2000 dollars is "a done deal" which results in -1333 equity, but that doesn't affect whether Alice should press her button or not.<br>
<br>
 In other words, Bob is going to press the button and lose 1333 equity.  If Alice presses the button, she will regain 333 equity to make the final result -1000.  If she does not press the button, the result will remain -1333 which is worse.<br>
<br>
 Edit: A commenter said, why doesn't Alice just <strong>not</strong> press the button and end up with 0 instead of -1000?<br>
<br>
 Response: Because it's always correct to press the button.  Suppose Bob decided to "wussy out" and not press the button.  That means that instead of Bob losing 1333 equity, he will have lost 0 equity.  Alice should still press the button and gain 333 equity.  Her decision is independent of Bob's decision.  Also, remember that the -1000 equity doesn't mean that pressing the button is going to lose money.  You always have to factor in the +5000 in case B that makes the final equity +500.  The decision is between pressing the button and making +500 <strong>overall considering all 4 cases</strong> and not pressing the button and making 0.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Another way to think about it</h2>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> Here's another way to think about it that might clear up the "paradox" for some people.  Suppose Alice and Bob were strangers instead of a couple.  And the rules were that if you press the button in heads case, <strong>you alone</strong> get 5000 dollars.  And in the tails case, anyone who presses the button loses 2000 dollars <strong>from their own bank account</strong>.  Now it is clear that you actually <strong>want</strong> to be picked.  Because if you are, your expected return from pressing the button is (1/3) * 5000 - (2/3) * 2000 = +333 dollars.  It doesn't matter that the other person might lose 2000 dollars.  Their best strategy overall is also to press the button.  It just happens that if you get picked, you know they will be losing 2000 dollars by pressing the button.</p>

<h2><a name="solution20595"></a><a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/20595">Is it always possible to balance a 4-legged table?</a></h2>

<p class="subtitle">51 Votes, asked by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/5373">Rand al'Thor#5373</a>, answered by <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/11876">Deusovi#11876</a></p>

<p>The answer is</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> yes!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's why:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> Imagine that the table can pass through the floor. We're going to call one leg the "floating leg" - the other three are going to always be on the floor. Now, after we rotate the table a quarter turn, the floating leg is going to be above the floor if it was originally below, or vice versa. By the intermediate value theorem, it will be exactly on the floor at one point in that rotation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More detailed proof:</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p>Three legs of the table define a plane. Define the "offset" of a leg to be the distance above the floor if the other three legs are placed on the floor directly - negative if below, positive if above. In any arbitrary placement, the offset of any two adjacent legs will be positive and negative. (WLOG assume the one on the left is positive.) Offset is a continuous function because it's the distance from the floor. If you start with a positive offset on leg A and rotate the table 90° to the right, the offset on leg A (now in the original position of another leg) will be negative. This means that at some point, offset was 0, therefore the table was completely touching the floor.</p>

 For a rectangle with less width than height do the same but move the first red line's ends nearer the centre and the second red line's ends nearer the quarter marks (at some point you can make $16$ corners instead though).</p>
